<h2>PREFACE.</h2>

<p class="noin">The Editor of this work, by Her Majesty's Artiste,
<span class="smcap">Mrs. Peachey</span>, fairly entitled the <span class="smcap">Royal Guide
to Wax Flower Modelling</span>, would fain leave
the introduction, written by the same hand which
rivals nature in her varying adornments, to unfold
its historic, its poetic, its moral, and its suggestive
graces&mdash;for it combines these; but having
accepted the part, without which, since the days
of Plato, no book is deemed complete, he essays
a few prefatory observations and remarks.</p>

<p>Brevity, it has been said, is the soul of wit;
but we may be brief when we know what is to
follow, and for whom the following pages are
designed.</p>

<p>Our fair readers will intuitively perceive that
the scope of the instructive portion of this self-commending<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
little volume is to facilitate their
acquisition of an accomplishment at once royal
and feminine in its origin and progress, and
therefore worthy of their attention.</p>

<p>This elegant art requires but the fairy touch of
a delicate hand to fill each available space in the
chamber or drawing-room with the most perfect
and beautiful imitations of the flower-garden.</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The morning flowers display their sweets,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gay their silken leaves unfold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As careless of the noontide heats,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As fearless of the winter cold.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Nipped by the wind's unkindly blast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Parched by the sun's directer ray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The momentary glories waste,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The short-lived beauties die away."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Unaffected by change or climate, wax flower
modelling perpetuates the transient glories of the
floral seasons; places all the tender varieties
under the immediate glance of the ever gratified
eye of the artist, who can thus in the depth of
winter exhibit to an admiring foreign guest the
exotics of the far hemisphere, or the indigenous
plants of her own loved land.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span></p>

<p>Who that has watched by the side of an invalid
mother, would not feel an exalted pleasure in
creating around her the magical representations
of those flowerets and rosebuds her maternal hand
was wont to rear? Who, in such a moment of
ministering affection, would not feel how sweet
the reward of a father's love, as his approving
gaze spoke more than many words his thanks to
the duteous child returning the early care of the
fond partner of his griefs and joys? Contemplating
such a scene as this, one cannot refrain
from citing the language of the poet:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O! if there be a tear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From passion's dross refined and clear;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tear so limpid and so meek,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would not stain an angel's cheek;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis that which pious fathers shed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a duteous daughter's head."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The copious table of contents possesses great
attraction for persons of refined taste, embracing
every variety of flower usually modelled in wax:
its arrangement is calculated to lead the learner,
by easy steps, from the most simple to the most
elaborate accomplishment of a very delightful
task.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span></p>

<p>The sketch of her artistic life, with which the
talented though unpretending authoress has favoured
the public, cannot fail to prove useful and
encouraging to the beginner, as it fully justifies
the good old proverb, that "where there is a
will, there is a way;" and that way is clearly
and forcibly pointed out in the <span class="smcap">Royal Guide</span>, so
as to direct with perfect ease the willing fingers
of the modeller to the attainment of her object,
to excel in giving form and substance to her
innate perceptions of the beautiful. Nor is this
a selfish pleasure. These productions of skilled
labour&mdash;if we may apply the word labour to an
amusement&mdash;please the beholder, as they do the
mind which calls forth the exquisite fancy which
pencils these flowers.</p>

<p>The unanimous verdict of the Press will be
found recorded at the end of the instructions.
It is a remarkable fact, that so many Journals,
giving in their separate awards, should have all
concurred in opinion. This opinion is highly
favourable to the Artiste and the art. The very
language in which it is couched partakes of
floweriness&mdash;if we may be pardoned for coining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
a word to express our meaning; indeed, we
strongly commend for perusal these elegant notices
of the Press; the writers evidently have
been influenced by national considerations; for
they speak of what they have seen as those convinced
that, although there may be several wax
flower modellers, there is but one <span class="smcap">Mrs. Peachey</span>&mdash;Her
Majesty's Artiste, and an Englishwoman.</p>

<p>It is with no insular feeling that we express
the same sentiment; but, nevertheless, we do feel
it to be something to boast of, that our countrywomen
will not have to learn the art of Wax
Flower Modelling from foreigners, many of whom
however have been amongst the now nearly
50,000 visitors attracted to the collection, by
the notices of the Press, and who have expressed
equal approbation.</p>

<p>The <span class="smcap">Royal Guide</span> is essentially a domestic
national instructor. But its teaching will not be
bounded by our island shores. We venture to
predict, that the <span class="smcap">Royal Guide to Wax Flower
Modelling</span> will, ere long, establish for itself a
more than European fame.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span></p>

<p>The Editor would now conclude the task he
has undertaken, and performed, as well as more
immediate professional calls upon his time would
permit, to the best of his abilities; but, beyond
changing or transposing a word or term here and
there, introducing some poetic gems, and correcting
the press, he does not claim any merit for
the work from his hands, that properly belongs
to the Authoress, who has been called into the
field, and to whom the reader is now fairly introduced,
as to a pleasing and accomplished
instructress in this Art.</p>

<div class="hd1"><h1 class="pub1"><small>PEACHEY'S ROYAL GUIDE<br />
<small><small>TO</small></small><br />
WAX FLOWER MODELLING.</small></h1></div>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Before</span> I commence my course of instruction in the fascinating
art of representing in wax the floral beauties of nature, I
deem it necessary to prelude by a brief explanation as to my
pretensions, and the cause of my offering such instructions to
the notice of the public.</p>

<p>I have constantly applied myself, during the last fourteen
years, in strictly copying from nature every flower that has
come under my notice, from the simple wild flowers of our
hallowed native fields, to the latest and rarest exotics brought
home by our most eminent collectors. I have also been
materially assisted in this particular branch of my art, by the
nobility and gentry having kindly granted me the indulgence
of selecting as copies, from their conservatories, aught that I
might consider as valuable additions to my specimens.</p>

<p>I have been frequently asked by my pupils to publish such
a work as the present; but diffidence, amounting perhaps to a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
weakness, has hitherto prevented me from even momentarily
exchanging the pencil of the artist for the pen of the author:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Authors, you know, of greatest fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through modesty, suppress their name."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noin">In the year 1847, I wrote several articles for the <i>Lady's
Newspaper</i>, in the shape of instruction in Wax Flower Modelling,
which articles appeared under the initials of "E. H., late
pupil of Mrs. Peachey." I must confess I felt much gratified
upon hearing my pupils, as well as other ladies, speak of these
articles in terms of commendation. I trust I may be pardoned
for this little piece of deception, and beg to remind
those who might regard the "ingenious device" with censure,
that Sir Walter Scott and many other writers of celebrity have
done the same. If great and talented persons shrink from
making their compositions known as their own creations, it is
not surprising that I, who have no pretension to literature,
should be equally tenacious of my incognito.</p>

<p>I have at this period determined upon publishing a book
of instructions, purely in consequence of feeling quite inadequate
to receive, as pupils, the numerous applicants that daily
visit me, and express much anxiety to be initiated into my
method of modelling and grouping.</p>

<p>They are two distinct things&mdash;to accomplish an art well,
and to impart it to others. I hope I may not be considered
egotistical in boldly asserting that, as an instructress, I stand
pre-eminent. I feel proud, most proud, in having received
repeated assurances from the distinguished and numerous
ladies who have placed themselves under my tuition, that my
method of teaching is such as to enable the most inexperienced
to acquire with facility a perfect knowledge of this pleasing art.</p>

<p>The distinguished patronage I have from the first received
at the hands of her Most Gracious Majesty, must surely convey
to the minds of all, that I have a right to lay claim to
artistic skill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span></p>

<p>When I first commenced the agreeable occupation of imitating
nature, I had not the slightest idea of ultimately making
it a profession. My anxious desire, I may say, my ambition,
was to produce something that might be considered worthy
the notice of our most Gracious Queen, who at the period I
allude to, 1837, had just ascended the throne.</p>

<p>A spirit of loyalty had been fostered in me from my
earliest infancy; and a pardonable glow of pleasure always
animates me, at the remembrance that I am the daughter of
an old officer, who served as surgeon in the British army the
long period of fifty years. The result of my wishes has been
great success. Our beloved Sovereign, ever ready to encourage
talent or industry in any form, condescended to permit a
bouquet, which I designed and executed for her inspection (in
token of my loyalty), to be placed as an ornament in one of
the royal palaces. This was indeed an honour I had scarcely
dared to anticipate. Two years after the period alluded to,
the Queen became acquainted with the fact, that a change of
circumstances had compelled me to make the art of wax flower
modelling a source of profit. Her Majesty, unsolicited by
any, spoke to the then Lord Chamberlain relative to a warrant
of appointment being granted to me; and I forthwith received
the Royal Letters Patent, being the first in this country
who enjoyed the privilege of being styled "Artist in Wax
Flowers to Her Majesty." I hope I may not be deemed
prolix in giving these particulars; it is not from any feeling
of vanity, but from gratitude due to the high power that encouraged
my talent in its infancy. The auspicious patronage
I received gave an impetus to my labours; and I have from
that royal day taxed my energies to the utmost, to prove that
my works deserved the high honour that had been conferred
upon them.</p>

<p>As this work is intended for the perusal of the young, as
well as the adult, I trust I may be pardoned for pausing a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
moment to dwell upon the all-wise dispensations of Providence.
The talent which inspired me would have been useless, had not
the "Giver of all good" discovered to me the knowledge that
I possessed it; and I wish to impress upon the notice of my
young friends and pupils, the advantage, I may say necessity,
of embracing every opportunity of improving any talent committed
to their charge; for my life has shown that what is
acquired as an accomplishment or amusement, may one day
become of vital importance to them.</p>

<p>It occurs to me, that it may not be uninteresting to many
of my readers, to become acquainted with the period and by
whom</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE ART OF MODELLING FLOWERS IN WAX WAS
BROUGHT INTO ENGLAND.</h3></div>

<p class="noin">I consequently subjoin an extract from Miss Strickland's Life
of Mary Beatrice, second consort of James II., <span class="smcapl">A.D.</span> 1686.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The beautiful imitations of natural flowers in wax which have lately
afforded an attractive exercise for the taste and ingenuity of many of our
youthful countrywomen, were first introduced into England by the mother
of Mary Beatrice, as a present to her royal daughter; as we find by the
following passage in a contemporary letter from a correspondent of the
Lady Margaret Russell, which gives some information relative to the ornamental
works then in vogue among ladies of rank, in the court of Mary
Beatrice.</p>

<p>"'In gum flowers, Mrs. Booth tells me you and she is to doe something
in that work, which I suppose must be extraordinary. I hope it will be
as great perfection as the fine <span class="smcapl">WAX WORK</span> ye queen has, of nun's work, of
fruit and flowers, that her mother did put up for her, and now she has 'em
both for her chapel and her rooms. I do not know whether they be the
four seasons of the year, but they say they are done so well, that they that
see 'em can hardly think 'em other than the real.'"<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_A_1"><span class="label">[A]</span></a> In the collection of private family letters of the Duke of Devonshire, at Chiswick
Lodge: copied by courteous permission of his Grace.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p></div>

<p>From the year last named until 1736 I have been unable
to trace any knowledge of this elegant art.</p>

<p>When wax flowers were again introduced by an Italian, they
were clumsily manufactured in comparison to those seen in the
present age of improvement; for I had the opportunity of
inspecting some of their "miserable remains" but a few years
since. Still I must acknowledge I discovered some taste and
much ingenuity in their construction, and am not too proud
to own that I benefited even by examining these very inferior
productions. I feel quite satisfied that the art of wax
flower modelling is almost still in its infancy. It is no longer
regarded as an amusement only. It is enumerated with other
accomplishments essential to female education. It assists
botanical studies, and promotes the views of flower painters,
either in oil or water colours; even in drawing, wax flowers
will be found excellent auxiliaries, far preferable as copies to
the even surface of plates. I have myself been much gratified
by furnishing flowers in wax to some of our first flower
painters, who have assured me that they have proved of great
utility, in cases where the evanescent properties of the flower
of nature prevented the possibility of committing their similitude
to canvas ere their beauty had faded. It affords me no
small degree of satisfaction also, that my flowers were found
useful as copies for some of the beautiful carved work in the
late great and ever memorable Exhibition. I have also supplied
them as illustrations to botanical lectures.</p>

<p>In thus referring to the utility of wax flowers, I am reminded
of a partially unfavourable prejudice which has lately
sprung up, from an article which first appeared in a Manchester
paper, and which was subsequently copied into <i>The
Times</i>, and other papers. It is possible ladies may be induced
to abandon this delightful amusement, upon reading such a
statement as the subjoined extract:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">The Danger of Modelling in Wax.</span>&mdash;Few persons, especially,
perhaps, of the many young ladies who are now practising the very pleasing
art of modelling fruits, flowers, &amp;c., in wax, at all suspect the great
danger in which they are placed from the poisonous nature of the colouring
matter of the wax which they handle so unsuspectingly. The white wax,
for instance, contains white lead; the green, copper; the yellow, chrome
yellow and vermilion&mdash;strong poisons all; while many other kinds of wax
are equally poisonous, and, therefore dangerous. There are very many
persons who are aware of the intense sufferings, for very many years past,
of Mr. W. Bally, phrenologist and modeller in wax, in which latter branch
he has laboured for 24 or 25 years, three of them as teacher of the art, at
the Manchester Mechanics' Institution. Mr. Bally has been at times completely
paralysed, and is now and has long been very nearly so, especially
in the hands and arms; and he has also been afflicted with extensive
ulceration of the throat, and has almost totally lost his voice. Both himself
and his medical adviser, after a long attention to his symptoms, are
satisfied that the primary cause of his affliction is the extent to which the
subtle poisons in the wax with which he has worked have been absorbed
into his system through the pores of his hands, while the disease has been
generally strengthened, and one part of it accounted for, by the occasional
application of his fingers to his lips while at work. Mr. Bally says, that
he has known several cases in which young ladies have been attacked with
partial paralysis of the hands and arms, after having devoted some time to
the practice of modelling; but at the time he had no suspicion of the
cause. As all the requisite colours can be obtained from vegetable matter,
and as the use of mineral colouring seems to lead to such deplorable results,
the subject should be carefully investigated by those working with coloured
wax."&mdash;<i>Manchester Examiner.</i></p></div>

<p>It is not my intention to contradict an assertion so boldly
set forth. I have no doubt the editor of the <i>Manchester
Examiner</i> had some grounds for the article; but I think it
right to state <i>that</i> which I can prove&mdash;namely, that the wax
<i>artistically manufactured by me</i> is so perfectly harmless, that
for the last fourteen years I have had it in my hands, upon an
average from twelve to fourteen hours every day (Sunday
excepted), and never in the slightest degree experienced any
inconvenience or ill effects.</p>

<p>The small portion of colour I introduce undergoes a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
chemical process, which neutralizes entirely any deleterious
properties appertaining to the few colours required to be used.
It is quite unnecessary to introduce white lead at all. I was
assisted by a practical German chemist to prepare borax,
in such a manner, as to entirely supersede white lead. Now
most of my readers will be able to testify how perfectly harmless
must be borax, it being one of the drugs so constantly
used with honey, and recommended by the faculty as an
excellent remedy for canker in the mouth. I am, as I have
previously stated, the daughter of a medical man, and am
perfectly acquainted with the danger attending the absorption
of mineral colours into the system: under these circumstances,
it is not likely that I should myself use that which would
be injurious. Ladies, who desire to enjoy the recreation of
wax flower modelling, may indulge in the amusement with
perfect safety, if they purchase the wax of me. At the same
time, I wish it to be perfectly understood, that I do not
insinuate, or attribute aught against any other person or
persons who prepare wax for sale.</p>

<p>I <span class="smcapl">DECIDEDLY OBJECT</span> to the dry colours being rubbed
into the wax with the fingers. I invariably apply the colours
with a brush. It must be injurious to close the pores of the
skin, even were the powders so used innocuous; but to say
nothing of the danger of the method alluded to, it is a most
dirty occupation, and ladies would not like to see their hands
dyed with carmine, Prussian blue, or chromes. Such a
method of tinting is likely to prejudice ladies against the
work altogether; besides which, it renders the flowers much
more fragile. The only time I ever use dry powder is in the
form of bloom (peculiarly prepared arrowroot), which I throw
on lightly, but never rub in. Having endeavoured to prove
that there are no dangerous results likely to accrue from this
pleasing occupation, I will proceed to shew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE ADVANTAGE OF WAX MODELLING, OVER
OTHER FANCY WORK.</h3></div>

<p class="noin">And one great consideration is that the sight is not likely to be
injured. The eye does not require to be fixed; it does not
occupy so much attention as to prevent conversation, nor need
the <i>body be bent</i>,&mdash;a matter of much importance with growing
girls, many having suffered affections of the chest, and others
disfigured for life, through continually stooping to frame work.</p>

<div class="hd1"><p class="inde">There is no monotony in this agreeable employment, for
new varieties are continually springing up in nature; and
a visit to the Botanical Gardens at Kew, or the Regent's
Park, will at all seasons afford some fresh specimen. In
referring to the former gardens, I cannot forbear expressing
the deep sense of obligation I feel due from the public, and
artists particularly&mdash;being myself one of them,&mdash;for the
boon bestowed upon us by those powers who afford such
facility for inspecting&mdash;free of charge&mdash;all that is lovely,
choice, and rare. It is perfectly clear, according to my
method, that the most elegant drawing room might be used,
without suffering in its appearance during its operations. I
would merely recommend that the table should be covered
with paper, so that all small pieces might be kept together,
and easily removed.</p></div>

<p>I will now proceed to name the</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR WAX FLOWER
MODELLING.</h3></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Wax</span>&mdash;white, yellow, orange, pink, and several shades
of green.</p>

<p>Two steel pins with china heads (different sizes).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>One ivory pin, with large head.</p>

<p>Eleven bottles of powder; consisting of scarlet, bright
crimson, dark crimson, lemon, yellow, orange, dark orange,
light blue, middle blue, dark blue, and white.</p>

<p>Twelve large brushes.</p>

<p>Two small brushes.</p>

<p>Twelve saucers.</p>

<p>Three skeins of white wire.</p>

<p>Two skeins of green do.</p>

<p>Two pieces of white marble, 3 to 4 inches square, &frac34; inch
thick.</p>

<p>One pair of sharp pointed scissors.</p>

<p>One cake of smalt.</p>

<p>One cake of sepia.</p>

<p>One cake of crimson lake.</p>

<div class="hd1"><p class="inde">One bottle of down.</p></div>

<p>Having given a list of the materials required for the elegant
and charming amusement of "Wax Flower Modelling,"
I deem it expedient to make a few remarks relative to the
properties of, and</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>PURPOSES TO WHICH THE MATERIALS ARE
APPLIED.</h3></div>

<p>Without wishing to derogate from the merit of others,
or retaining to myself the exclusive ability of vending the
purest wax and the best of other articles to be used in obtaining
a faithful representation of nature, I think it necessary
to state, that I offer to the public materials only of the very
best quality; consequently, I take the prices of other persons'
goods as no criterion or standard for mine. The wax
is manufactured under my own immediate superintendence;
soft, and perfectly dull on one side. It is sufficiently opaque<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of itself not to require being painted on the wrong side for
white flowers, which is the case with common wax. I likewise
prepare wax, called "double wax," it is twice as
thick as the ordinary wax. When the single wax is used
double, the two shining sides should be placed together.
It has sheets of tissue paper placed between it to keep each
sheet of wax smooth and straight (a great advantage,) for
when this is not done (though the wax may be good), the
edges are often wrinkled, and a great deal of waste is the
consequence.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Colours</span>&mdash;eleven in number, submitted for sale on
my counters, 160, 161, 162, 163, Soho Bazaar, are of the
very best quality, and ground down particularly fine in spirits.
I recommend saucers instead of a flat pallet, as it is not
necessary to use up at once all the colour that is mixed; and
by keeping each colour distinct in separate saucers, much
waste is prevented.</p>

<p>Twelve brushes are indispensable; each to be confined
to the use of one colour. Two small sable brushes are for
veining, as in geraniums.</p>

<p>The large ivory pin is required for the Victoria Regia,
water-lily, and other large flowers.</p>

<p>The two smaller pins are to be used for similar purposes,
on flowers of less magnitude.</p>

<p>The cake colours are never to be used alone, but rubbed
down with the powder, as will be shown in my instructions
for mixing colours.</p>

<p>The large white wire is to be used as stems for flowers,
such as dahlia, camellia, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The second and finest white wire to support the petals.</p>

<p>The green wire, Nos. 1 and 2, are for stems of various
flowers.</p>

<div class="hd1"><p class="inde">The square pieces of marble are of great utility in rolling
fine filaments, or rays, for the various kinds of passion flowers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
It is a much quicker and cleaner method than rolling them
with the fingers.</p></div>

<p>I think it necessary to give some</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>DIRECTIONS FOR MIXING COLOURS.</h3></div>

<p>Place the powder required in a saucer: add a few drops
of water, and rub the same with a brush for some time; as
friction materially improves the brilliancy of tint. The colour
should be mixed as thick as cream, but a very small portion
taken into the brush at one time. As the brushes are large,
they absorb a large quantity of colour; consequently, the
brush used to mix the colour with, must be pressed upon
the edge of the saucer several times to cleanse it.</p>

<p>The cake paint is used with the powder colours for fine
veining, and when a second colour is required to be placed
over another; as I shall show in my instruction for the rich
dahlia purpurea. I have a great objection to mixing gum
water with the colours. I use it only previous to throwing
on down, such as in the calyx of geranium, primrose, &amp;c.</p>

<p>A rich crimson is produced by the application of the
crimson powder upon pink wax.</p>

<p>A darker crimson, by adding a little of the darkest crimson
powder to the former. If a deeper crimson still be
required, add a little of the middle blue.</p>

<p>A pale pink is obtained by applying crimson powder with
a small portion of white, laid on the wax very thin.</p>

<p>A light orange scarlet, as in fuchsia fulgens, is acquired
by mixing a minute portion of scarlet powder with the bright
crimson.</p>

<p>Scarlet for geranium; a larger portion of the scarlet with
the crimson.</p>

<p>Different shades of scarlet are also produced by laying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the crimson powder upon different shades of wax, namely,
lemon, yellow, and orange.</p>

<p>A purple (as in violet), is produced by mixing the second
blue with a lesser portion of the bright crimson powder.</p>

<p>A deeper purple, as in the centre of the anemone, is
obtained by the combination of the crimson powder with the
deepest blue.</p>

<p>Various shades of lilac and peach colours are produced
by a careful admixture of the bright crimson, middle blue,
and white.</p>

<p>A primrose colour is obtained by using my lemon powder
(a beautiful preparation), upon white wax.</p>

<p>A rich brown, as in wall-flower, requires a mixture of cake
sepia with bright crimson.</p>

<p>The dark velvet-purple-looking spot seen in geraniums is
obtained from mixing the cake smalt with a little bright
crimson powder.</p>

<p>A similar tint may be obtained by mixing crimson lake,
in cake, with the middle blue.</p>

<div class="hd1"><p class="inde">Various shades of green are procured by combining the
first or second yellow with the darkest blue.</p></div>

<p>In noticing the</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>USE OF CURLING PINS AND SCISSORS,</h3></div>

<p>I beg to remind my readers that these are the only instruments
I deem requisite for modelling wax flowers. Both
these require to be moistened before they are applied to
the wax. Warmth as well as moisture is essential for these.
A glass of lukewarm water will answer the purpose; but
great care must be taken to shake off the surplus water; for
if the globules were to fall upon the petal, it would occasion
the colour to run.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE METHOD OF APPLYING BRUSHES</h3></div>
<p class="noin">requires to be stated; for they must not be held as a pen or
pencil, but perfectly perpendicular. Commence a short distance
from the lower end of the petals&mdash;for where the paint is
applied the wax will not adhere. When the petal is all one
colour, pass the brush from you quickly and lightly off the
same on to the paper. If it is a variegated petal, bring the
brush towards you. This will enable you to soften off the
edges of the spots which are to be left free from colour.
When moisture is required in the brush, the latter must not
be plunged into water, but a small drop taken up by the
handle on to the paper.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>TO CLEANSE THE SCISSORS, PINS, AND MARBLES.</h3></div>

<p>Dip either into boiling water, and wipe them immediately.
The marbles require to be used warm.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>EXPLANATION OF BOTANICAL WORDS.</h3></div>

<p>Although I do not pretend to put this forth as a "Botanical
work," I deem it necessary that I should make use of
certain words in application to forming the different parts of a
flower; I shall give an explanation of such botanical words
as I must occasionally make use of in the course of my instructions.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Corolla</span> signifies a flower deprived of its centre. For example:
the corolla of a rhododendron falls from its position,
leaving the interior of the flower pendent to the stem. The
convolvulus has a funnel-shaped corolla.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Petal.</span> This is part of the corolla, and what is termed,
by the uninformed&mdash;leaf; for instance, we hear of drying rose
leaves, when in fact it is the petals that are alluded to. The
term leaf should only be applied to the foliage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Pistil</span>, or <span class="smcap">Pistillum</span>, is that part of a flower which
projects directly from the centre, and is longer than the rest;
we observe it in the white lily, fuchsia, honeysuckle, etc.
The enlargement at the end of the pistil is termed stigma.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stamens</span>, or <span class="smcap">Stamina</span>, signify the filaments that surround
the pistil; and the enlarged part at the end of each filament is
called anther.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Farina</span> is the fine dust which is contained in the anther,
and which shows itself also outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Calyx</span> is applied to the green attached to the flower. For
example: the part that is covered with moss about the rose is
the calyx. Sometimes the calyx is covered with down, as in
geranium, primrose, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stigma.</span> The enlargement at the end of the pistillum.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>HOW TO COPY FROM NATURE.</h3></div>

<p>To take the pattern of a natural flower, you must remove
the petals carefully, sorting out how many there are of an
equal size. Take the shape of one out of each set, in the
following manner: Place the petal upon a sheet of writing
paper, holding it firmly to the paper with the point of the
fore finger of the left hand. Take a large brush containing a
very little colour and pass it round the edge. The exact form
will be left upon the paper without tearing the edges of the
petal, even though it were unusually fragile. When the requisite
flower cannot be procured, a proper pattern can be
obtained at Soho Bazaar, or at my residence, 35, Rathbone
Place, where I am happy to receive visitors, daily, from ten in
the morning till six o'clock in the evening. Place the pattern
upon the dull side of the wax, and as the grain runs the length
of the same, cut each petal accordingly, for the wax takes the
paint much better in that direction.</p>

<p class="noin">As it will be impossible in a small volume to give instructions
in all Flowers, I shall endeavour to select such as will
produce a pleasing contrast of form and colour; at the same
time, including flowers of every season, commencing with
Spring&mdash;and who does not hail the early Flowers with delight?
After a long and severe winter, the appearance of the golden
crocus and the modest snowdrop, peeping from the earth, convey
to the mind a glow of unspeakable pleasure.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>INSTRUCTION HOW TO FORM THE CROCUS.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Crocus Luteus.</span>) <i>Youthfulness.</i></h4></div>

<p>Prepare the petals (from pattern) in double wax, choosing
a bright orange, but not too dark. Place the two shining
sides of the wax together. The inner petals are not striped,
but the three outer ones have eight or ten pencil strokes of a
middle shade of green, broad towards the lower end, and
carried off to fine points; these strokes do not extend beyond
two thirds of the flower, and laid on with the sable brush.
Cup the petals very much with a large head pin (this is why
they require to be cut from double wax) so firmly that each
petal produces an egg-shaped form when united. Double a
hem in a piece of wax the same as that from which you have
previously cut the petals. Prepare the stamina from this piece
of wax by snipping the proper number. The hem at the edge
of the wax is to represent the anthers; affix the stamina when
so prepared to the end of a piece of strong wire, and cover
them with farina (my second yellow powder). Place the petals
round the stamina&mdash;first, the three not painted&mdash;and the remaining
three in the intervening spaces.</p>

<p>The calyx is prepared in lemon wax, tinged with a little
brown, and is passed round the end of the flower. The stem
covered with pale lemon wax. The leaves narrow strips of
double wax (dark green), strongly indented with the point of
the pin, and a white stripe laid smoothly on with the small
sable brush.</p>

<p>The above directions will answer for the crocus susianus,
the cloth of gold, striped orange, and very dark purple; besides
the Scotch crocus, striped, white, and purple.</p>

<span class="i0">From the turf, like the voice and the instrument."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This charming, pensive little flower should be prepared
from double white wax. It consists of six petals, like its
companion the crocus. The longest are left perfectly white,
the others striped upon the inside with very light green paint;
and upon the opposite or exterior side of the petal is placed a
triangular green spot, near the off end. Cut a fine green wire,
three inches long, cover it with a strip of light green wax,
affix to the end the stamina, cut from yellow wax. Place
round these the striped petals, and those that are quite white
immediately between; finish off the same by placing a little
double green wax at the end of the flower, which forms the
calyx; the flower-stalk is then to be attached to a stronger
stem. Where they are united place a small sheath, cut from
lemon wax, tinge round the edge with light green. The
leaves are rather narrow, not so dark as the crocus; made
from double wax. The head of the pin is merely rolled down
the centre: they are attached a short way down the stem.</p>

<p>This unassuming pretty flower has a salver-shaped corolla;
but in modelling it, I advise its being formed of five petals.
Prepare the latter in double white wax, colour them upon both
sides with my lemon powder (this is a most beautiful preparation),
taking the precaution not to carry the same to the end,
or it would prevent adhesion of the wax. With a small sable
brush, form a triangular spot of deep yellow at the lower end
of the broad part of the petal. Attach to the end of a second-size
wire a piece of lemon wax, extending the same half an
inch down the stem; this is to form a foundation: the point
is to be neatly moulded, and to be seen peeping, as it were,
from the centre of the flower. The petals are curled in the
following manner;&mdash;rest the petal in the palm of the left
hand, placing the side that has the triangular spot downwards,
press the third finger of the right hand in the centre, and then
upon the opposite side strongly indent with the point of the
pin. Place the five petals thus prepared round the stem previously
formed, press the petals neatly together, flattening
them down a little to give the appearance of being formed in
one piece. The calyx is cut in very light green wax, it is in
one piece, vandyked at the top into five points; in each point
press the pin, and attach it afterwards round the neck or tube
of the flower. Wash the calyx with a weak solution of gum
water, using for the purpose a sable brush. Sprinkle it over,
while moist, with a little of my prepared down. The stem
should look transparent, consequently the wire must be covered
with very light green or lemon wax. For the leaf, see my
general instructions upon foliage.</p>

<p>Prepare the petals in white wax: there are five in number.
Pass the head of a large pin firmly down the centre, so as to
cup each. Cover a fine green wire with a strip of light green
wax; at the end of this affix a small piece of orange wax, and
mould it to a point, not allowing it to be larger than a carraway
seed. Dip the point of this foundation in water, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
into the second yellow powder, which gives it the appearance
of farina. Place three petals under the foundation, and the
remaining two on the top, turning them back; bend the stalk
up, and under the three petals place a small piece of white
wax, which is to be coloured purple after it is attached. The
calyx consists of five points, and are placed round the neck of
the flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>PURPLE VIOLETS.</h3></div>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>Purple violets are constructed precisely the same as the
former; the only difference that exists being that the petals
require to be cut from blue wax, and painted upon both sides
with purple (bright crimson and middle blue.)</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 16em;"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<div class="hd2"><h3>ANEMONE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Anemone Hortensis.</span>) <i>Sickness.</i></h4></div>

<p>The petals are cut from thick or double white wax. Place a
piece of fine white wire half way up each, and secure it to its
position by placing a narrow strip of white wax upon the same,
rolling it down each edge with the head of the smallest pin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
Colour them from the centre to the point with bright purple
(second blue and bright crimson), the large brush to be used,
(see my directions, p. <a href="#Page_13">13</a>.) The small petals are cupped by
laying each in the palm of the left hand, and pressing it firmly
with the thumb of the right hand. The large or outside
petals are curled in the same manner, but the points turned
back. The centre or foundation is formed by passing two
strips of double pink wax round the end of a strong wire,
(care must be taken at all times to double the wire down to
prevent its slipping;) mould the same to a point, leaving it
broad at the lower end; indent it strongly round with the
curling pin; colour this half way down with dark or black-looking
purple, (dark blue and crimson.)</p>

<p>The stamina are also formed from pink wax: first roll a
whip (as in muslin) which produces the anthers, and cut a
fringe the third of an inch deep. Wind the same around the
previously formed centre, and then brush them out with the
dark purple brush that has been applied to the foundation.
When thoroughly dry, touch the ends occasionally with green;
this must be done with the sable brush. At the back of the
pulp first formed, close to the wire, affix the small petals at
equal distance, and the large ones, which turn back, in the
intervening spaces. When the anemone is in bud, it is surrounded
by a calyx, but as it expands it rises and leaves the
said calyx at least one inch down the stem; it has a fringed
appearance, and is prepared from double green wax. The
stem is covered neatly with light green wax.</p>

<p>The anemones grow in great variety of colour, but this
instruction, as to form and centre, is applicable to all. The
brilliant scarlet and purple, contrasted with the pink, lemon,
and white, form a pretty group by themselves.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>TULIP VAN THOL.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Tulipa Pr&aelig;cox.</span>) <i>Declaration of Love.</i></h4></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Flowers are the brightest things which earth<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Like fading dreams of hope they perish."<br /></span>
<span class="rgt">Patterson.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Prepare the petals from double yellow wax, placing the
shining sides together, a fine white wire half way up between.
Form two distinct creases up the centre with the point of the
pin; with the head of the latter cup the broad part of the petal.
Turn the edges inward towards the point, and colour each
petal upon both sides with the crimson powder, softening off
the same, and leaving a margin of the yellow free from colour.
The stamina are prepared (according to pattern), from double
yellow wax, and painted with rich brown (cake sepia and
crimson), from the broad part to the point. To a large wire
affix a piece of double green wax, cover the same with lemon
wax, and press it into a triangular form: place a strip of
double green wax three quarters of an inch from this point, to
form a foundation to attach the petals to. Place round the
foundation the brown stamina previously prepared, and then
attach the petals, in rows of three or five; they vary very
much in number, some flowers being much more double than
others.</p>

<p>The remarks in the foregoing instructions on the "Van
Thol Tulip," are also applicable to the Summer Tulip; the
centre is formed the same, but rather larger; nature must
do the rest. The great beauty of the flower in the florist's
eye, consists in its being cup-shaped and round at the base.
The ground colour of the flower ought also to be very clear
and bright in the centre.</p>

<p>Cut six petals in double white wax; indent up the centre of
each with the point of a curling pin; press against this crease
upon the opposite side, so as to produce a ribbed appearance.
Pass the head of the curling pin down on each side of the previously
named crease, and press the petals back. Cut a strip
of yellow wax half an inch deep and one inch and a half in
length; plait it up at one edge, and join it round to form a cup.
To the end of a piece of middle size wire attach the stamina,
draw the same through the cup, and fasten it underneath.
Take a slip of pale green wax, and wind round the wire under
the cup, to form the tube or neck of the flower. Attach three
petals in a triangular form immediately under the cup, and
the remaining three immediately between those preceding.</p>

<p>The daisy may be made entirely white, crimson tipped, or
crimson all over the petals: the latter are cut in single white
wax, a strip at once the width of a sheet of wax. After the
petals are coloured, the pin is deeply indented into each,
some in fact are made quite round. The flower grows single
and double, so that there is no decided number required;
this must be left to the taste of the copyists; but if they prefer
the double flower, the eye or centre is scarcely visible. On
the contrary, if it is a single flower that is to be imitated, the
eye must be increased. To form the latter, take a sheet of
yellow wax, fold it at the end the eighth of an inch deep, hold
it between the thumb and finger of the left hand, and with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
point of the curling pin indent the edge closely the whole
length, and pass round the end of the middle wire, letting it
rise a little in the centre. The petals are then attached very
closely, and as many as form the double or single flower,
whichever may be preferred. The calyx is green, and placed
on similarly to the petals.</p>

colour the edges, and vein each a rich brown (crimson powder
and cake sepia). Press the finger in the centre of every petal,
for the purpose of giving a crumpled appearance.</p>

<p>Use a piece of middle size wire; cover it with green wax,
and affix to the end four stamina, made in the following
manner: Double along the end of a sheet of lemon wax (a
narrow fold); cut the stamina short and fine; colour the ends
with my lemon powder. Place the petals immediately under;
putting them on so as to form a square. The calyx is cut
from green wax passed round the tube of the flower, and
coloured afterwards with the same brush that has been used
for the flower. The buds are made of solid wax; some green,
others orange; and painted with the rich brown in various
shades. In the largest buds, leave the orange points free
from paint, at the point peeping from beneath the dark calyx.</p>

<p>Having now submitted what I consider a fair selection
from spring flowers, I will proceed to those which we may
observe at a later period, commencing with the rhododendron.
This is one of a class of flowers which I admire most particularly
in nature, and also find extremely useful in an artistic
point of view. Its form is peculiarly eligible in grouping,
and its value increased from the fact, that it is cultivated
at the present time in such great varieties of shades and
colours. I do not know that I can experience a greater
treat than to visit the Botanical Gardens, Regent's Park, when
their show of American plants is on view; and I would
recommend my pupils to devote some time to perfect themselves
in flowers that afford such great variety; and as instruction
as to the formation of one conveys the same for all, except
as to varying the colour, I do not feel that I could choose a
more advantageous specimen of floriculture for imitation.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>LILAC RHODODENDRON.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Danger.</i></h4>

<p>Cut the petals in white wax; chose it rather thick, but
not the double wax. It is formed with two pieces, and yet
when united it appears as if there were five petals. The
colour is produced in any shade of lilac by mixing my bright
crimson, middle blue, and a small portion of white together.
This is laid on round the edge upon both sides with a large
brush. When perfectly dry, the colour is partly taken off
by passing a moist brush containing very little colour over
the whole. This carries off the rough portion of the paint
previously applied, and gives the petals a soft and shaded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
appearance. Press the curling pin up the centre of each
point, and pinch against it so as to form a distinct seam.
Roll the head of the pin down each side of the seam, which
will occasion the edges of the petal to look a little crumpled.
Unite the petals neatly together, making a small plait between
each. Form the pistil of double wax: thicken it at the end
to represent the stigma. The stamina are produced by folding
the end of a sheet of wax so as to produce the same appearance
as a hem in muslin, and cut ten fine filaments for each
flower (the hem represents the anthers). Colour the pistil and
stamina pale pink: darken the end of the pistil to a deep
crimson. Touch the ends of the stamina with a sable brush
moistened with brown (crimson powder, orange powder, and
cake sepia); while wet, dip them into farina (produced by
mixing my lemon powder with white, quite dry). Cut a piece
of wire, three inches long, middle size: pass a small piece of
light green wax round the end, and double the wire down;
then attach the pistil to it, and place the stamina round, taking
care that the pistil rises above the stamina. The centre petal
of each flower is dotted with brown, the same colour previously
used for the anthers. The stem is passed through the centre
of the corolla, pressing the edges of the latter neatly to the
wire. It is one of those flowers that has not a calyx attached
close to the flower, but is shaded lightly round the end with
a crimson brush. The flowers are mounted in clusters,
varying in number: seven form a pretty size. When the
flowers are united, a cluster of small points of very light
green wax are placed: these are what are termed by botanists,
"calyx involucre," signifying that such calyx is remote from
the flower. Place three or four leaves round the stem, a

<div class="hd2"><h3>KALMIA.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Latifolia.</span>) <i>Combination.</i></h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ye flowers of beauty, pencilled by the hand of God!"<br /></span>
<span class="rgt">Pollok.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The corolla is in one piece, having five points. It requires
to be cut in thick wax. Press the finger in the centre, and
pinch up each point, bending the same towards the centre.
A double piece of wax, cut in points, is placed at the back;
press the two firmly together, and make a hole in the centre
with the large pin. Paint in the corolla a small circle of
crimson points, using for this purpose a sable brush. Cover a
piece of fine wire two inches in length; mould to the end a
small piece of double green wax, making it quite round. The
pistil is affixed to this, and is formed by rolling the edge of
the wax (as a whip in muslin), and cutting it fine, as previously
directed. The stamina are prepared in the same manner, consisting
of ten filaments, and are placed round the pistil. Pass
the stalk through the centre of the corolla, rendering it secure
by pressing the fingers close to the flower underneath. Finish
off the flower by attaching five minute points of green wax.
After the pistil and stamina are drawn through the flower,
press the anther of each filament down to the corolla with the
head of the pin, and tip them with deep crimson.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>YELLOW JASMINE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Jasminum Revolutum.</span>) <i>Grace and Elegance.</i></h4></div>

<p>Cut the petals from double yellow wax. There are five to
each flower. Pass the head of the small curling pin quickly
twice down each petal; and indent it strongly down the narrow
or tube part of each petal upon the opposite side. Cover
a piece of fine wire, about three inches long; affix a small
piece of green wax, pressed into a point by the side of, and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the end of, the said points. Dip the latter into water, and
while wet, into the yellow powder, to represent farina. Place
the five petals around, pressing each on neatly and firmly,
permitting the points or stamina to be seen just rising from
the neck or tube of the flower. Pass a small piece of green
wax round the lower end of the tube to form the calyx. Some
buds may be formed from wax, wound round wire, and made
solid; others of petals closed. About four flowers, and three
or four buds, form a pretty and useful cluster; but the number
may be increased or diminished at pleasure.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>WHITE JASMINE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Jasminum Officinale.</span>) <i>Amiableness.</i></h4></div>

<p>The petals are prepared from thick or double white wax.
It is put together precisely as the last named flower; but the
petals are pointed, instead of being round, as in the yellow.
Press the point of the curling pin up the centre of each petal.
After the flower is united, the tube is tinged, first with pale
yellow, and subsequently with red, very slightly. The calyx
consists of five fine points, which are cut in green wax, and
attached at the bottom of the tube. The flowers are mounted
like the yellow jasmine. The green sprigs are placed on two
at once, facing each other.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>CAPE JASMINE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Gardenia.</span>) <i>Sweetness.</i></h4></div>

<p>The petals are cut in thick wax, or single wax doubled;
when the latter is the case, be careful to place the two shining
sides together. It is particularly easy to form: the petals
require to be curled precisely as the yellow jasmine. The
centre is formed by crushing two or three small pieces of
orange wax to the point of a wire. The first five small
petals are very faintly tinged with orange; this is merely to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
give warmth to the centre of the flower, to make up for the
deficiency of the life-glow, if I may use this term&mdash;great care
must therefore be taken not to make it too dark. All the
succeeding petals are placed on in rows of five, turning some
of the petals forward towards the centre of the flower.</p>

<p>The neck of the flower is already formed from the ends of
the petals; it only requires to be moulded very smooth, and
coloured a light pomona green. The calyx consists of five
points of green wax, placed at the end of the tube. The dark
foliage is placed round in clusters, and produces a pleasing
contrast to the flower. I would here observe, that this flower
is particularly useful in grouping. It is a greenhouse production,
and extremely fragrant in nature; it is consequently
always consistent to place it in a bouquet; independently of
this, it is an excellent substitute for white camellia in groups,
where the last named flower would be too large.</p>

<hr style="visibility: visible;" />

<p>I shall proceed to give some instruction in Roses. The
varieties now grown and named in our nurseries amount to the
almost incredible number of two thousand. I shall therefore
choose, for the information and improvement of those ladies
who kindly think proper to place themselves under the guidance
of my little book, about six kinds, such as I deem most
useful, and as being different in form and colour. I think,
when these are perfectly understood, any other kind can be
copied easily from nature. I shall commence with the old
favourite,</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE CABBAGE OR PROVENCE ROSE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Rosa Centifolia.</span>) <i>Beauty.</i></h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="rgt">Watts.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>Cut the petals from pale pink wax; colour the three
smallest rather deep with the crimson powder. The split
petals, marked on my pattern fifteen, are coloured the same,
but rather a lighter hue. Each succeeding set are painted the
same, but gradually diminish the colour until you arrive at the
outer petals, which are the lightest of all. To form the petals,
use a pin as little as possible; cupping them with the thumb
or finger, according to its size. For the largest petals, use the
thumb, so pressing each in the centre, while it is resting in the
palm of the left hand, as to become perfectly round. The last
two or outer rows are turned back with the head of a curling
pin.</p>

<p>Prepare the foundation of solid wax, rolled round the end
of a moderate size wire. It must be cone-shaped. The three
smallest petals are crushed and placed at the point in a triangular
form. The split petals, marked on my pattern fifteen,
are united into clusters of five, and placed round immediately
under the three that are crushed. Each succeeding row of
petals are placed on in like manner, taking care that each petal
is attached to the under part of the foundation, and not upon
the side. I particularly name this, as I too frequently find ladies
err in forming the roundness of the rose. The last two rows
of petals, which are turned back, must be placed rather lower
than those preceding. The calyx is cut from double light
green wax.</p>

<p>The head of the curling pin is passed down the centre of
each point previously to their being placed on. Pass a strip of
double green wax close round the base of the flower, moulding
it round and smooth with the thumb and finger. This is to
represent the seed cup. When the calyx is affixed, it must
rest against the back of the rose, and be so neatly moulded
over the seed cup, as not to show any division or seam.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE MOSS ROSE.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Beauty and Love.</i></h4></div>

<p class="noin">Is similarly constructed (being one of the same class), but is
rather smaller. It requires the addition of a little real moss.
It must be the fine spray moss; and dried quickly, by placing
a warm flat-iron upon it. It is affixed to the calyx and seed
cup by pressing it on with the head of the curling pin.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE WHITE ROSE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Rose Alba.</span>) <i>Silence.</i></h4></div>

<p>Cut the petals from thin white wax. Tinge the lower part
of the first three sets of petals with my lemon powder. Cup
all the petals with the finger, turning the last or largest two
rows back. Cut a few stamina in lemon wax, with the edge
rolled to form the anthers; colour them with orange, and
when quite dry, touch them occasionally with brown (crimson
powder and cake sepia). These stamina are divided into clusters,
eight or ten filaments in each, and about five in number.
Make a small cone-shaped foundation; attach one cluster of
stamina at the point. The ten small petals are affixed round,
turning in various directions, and interspersed with the rest of
the stamina. The whole of the remaining petals are placed
on five in a row, the last two turning back. Finish off with
calyx and seed cup, as in previous instruction. This rose is
peculiarly adapted for bridal bouquets; and I must here mention,
while alluding to the subject of bridal favours, that I
made upwards of ten thousand of these roses upon the happy
occasion of Her Majesty's marriage. It may afford some
trivial amusement to my younger friends, to relate the following
anecdote, in connection with the event just alluded to.
About three years after Her Majesty was united to His Royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Highness Prince Albert, a gentleman visited my establishment,
and inspected my specimens of flowers in wax with evident
satisfaction. He represented himself as being a great admirer
of wax-work generally; and stated, that he himself possessed
a rare specimen, in fact, a perfect <i>bijou</i>. He should wish me
to see it. I, of course, expressed some anxiety to behold such
perfection of art; and accordingly, he sent his footman with a
small box, charged with strict orders to be particularly careful
in conveying the same. After removing sundry pieces of tissue
paper, and as many of wadding, my surprise may be easily
imagined, when I beheld one of the identical bouquets (white
rose, orange blossom, and myrtle, tied with white satin ribbon)
that I had myself manufactured upon the joyous occasion
already alluded to. I am but human nature, therefore, I hope
I may be pardoned for expressing and feeling a certain degree
of vanity upon inspecting this Royal relic of my own hands;
still, I am not blind to the fact, that the happy occasion for
which the bouquet had been prepared, namely, the nuptials of
our beloved Sovereign, had materially enhanced its value to the
possessor;&mdash;but I will no longer digress from the leading
feature of this work, but commence the description of the
formation of</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE DAMASK ROSE.</h3>

<span class="i0">"The rose, like ruddy youth, in beauty stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And would be cropped by none but fairest hands."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Cut the petals from white wax, and paint them upon both
sides (with my crimson), two-thirds down. Cup the petals as
in the preceding rose. Cut two strips of stamina in lemon
wax, tip them with my orange powder. Make a foundation
of lemon wax, and pass round the strips already mentioned.
Place in a triangular form the six small petals in clusters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
two; the next two sets are attached in like manner at the
intermediate spaces, the rest of the petals are placed on singly,
five in each row, the largest to turn back: finish off with seed
cup and calyx as before named. It is particularly necessary
that the smallest or internal petals should not be coloured too
low down, as the white in the centre gives great relief to the
flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>SWEET-SCENTED TEA ROSE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Rosa Safrano.</span>) <i>Charming.</i></h4></div>

<p>The petals of this rose require to be cut in thick white
wax, coloured three parts down with my lemon powder;
shade lightly over this, but not quite to the edge, with a little
of my second yellow, and finish off by a light tint of crimson
(crimson lake in cake.) The petals are deep and few, and
require a great deal of cupping; to assist in producing this
rotundity of petal use the head of the ivory pin, commencing
to roll from the bottom to about half-way up the petal. Make
a foundation of white wax, rather large and cone-shaped;
colour it the same as petals; place the latter on singly, and
press them forward to meet at the point and conceal the
foundation. They are placed on five in a row, and the last
two turned back: the seed cup is rather small; the calyx, and
the back petals are all deeply coloured with crimson. The
stem is also very red.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>YELLOW ROSE.</h3>

<p>Cut the petals from light lemon wax, colour them with
deep yellow towards the lower end, gradually shading off the
same towards the upper end of each petal. The first three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
sets of petals are placed on in clusters of five, the others
singly in rows of five. The foundation is made similar to the

flower. Calyx and seed cup formed as usual.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>AUSTRIAN BRIAR ROSE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Rosa Lutea.</span>) <i>Mingled Pleasure and Pain.</i></h4></div>

<p>This is a showy single flower, and very easily and quickly
accomplished. There are but five petals, cut from bright
yellow wax; colour them half-way down each with crimson:
cup them a little in the palm of the hand, not using a pin at
all. The foundation is rather small, and formed of green
wax&mdash;one strip of stamina placed round, cut in lemon wax,
tipped with orange powder. Calyx and seed cup formed
according to previous instruction.</p>

<p>Having given as many roses as my space will admit of,
and as will be required for the purpose of initiating learners in
this kind of flower, I will turn the attention of my readers to
another class, held in much esteem, and which will afford a
wide field of variety to copyists. I allude to</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE CARNATION.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Dianthus.</span>) <i>Pure Love.</i></h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yon bright carnation&mdash;once thy cheek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bent o'er it in the bud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And back it gives thy blushes meek<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In one rejoicing flood!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This may be made in three varieties. The flakes are
striped with broad bands of colour, the bizarres are striped
with three colours, and the picotees have a narrow margin of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
streaks and spots; they are all painted with a sable brush.
To enable the wax to take the fine pencil marks, moisture
from the lips must be conveyed with the finger to the petal.
Make the strokes or bands broad near the edge of the petal,
and gradually diminish them to a fine point towards the lower
end. The petals are curled as follows:&mdash;press each in the
palm of the left hand, and roll the head of the pin twice or
three times down the painted side of the petal, taking care to
do so between, and not upon the stripes. Roll the pin once
up the back of the petal, commencing from the bottom, and
not extending the same above half-way up. Cover the stem
with green wax, and place the petals on in rows of five. The
calyx is cut from double wax (light green); it is in one piece,
with five points. It is shaded rather dark green in the centre,
and the points tipped with red (very faint.) It is passed round
the tube of the flower; at the base of the same affix six small
pieces of wax, as scales.</p>

<p>The leaf is long and narrow, cut from double wax, and a
fine wire covered and placed between to support it. To give
it the natural bloom, pass it through the prepared arrowroot.
The leaves are placed on the stem two and two, to face each
other, and a small piece of lemon wax passed round, to represent
the joint that is always visible in this flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>MYRTLE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Myrtus Communis.</span>) <i>Love.</i></h4></div>

<p>This flower is always admired in a bouquet from its light
and pretty appearance, and is in nature very fragrant. Cut
the petals, five in number, of double wax, indent the head of a
curling pin in each; cut a fringe at the end of a thin sheet of
white wax, having previously folded a very small piece down
to form the anthers. Wind this strip or fringe round the end<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
of the finest wire, taking care to double the latter down.
Brush these filaments all out, and tip them at the points with
my lemon powder: place the five petals round. The calyx is
a row of small points cut in light green wax; the points are
touched with a brush containing a little brown, and then
passed once round the flower. The stalk is covered with a light
green, but partially coloured with brown also. The buds
are made very round, of solid wax, and a calyx affixed to them
like the flower. To make the foliage, look at my instructions.
Commence mounting the flower at the top of a wire; four
or six leaves must be attached first, two and two, then the
buds in like order, leaves under each, and lastly the flowers.
About four or six make a pretty spray.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>HONEYSUCKLE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Caprifolium.</span>) <i>Devoted Affection.</i></h4></div>

<p>Colour eight or ten blossoms with second yellow, two or
three are left white, being all cut from wax devoid of colour;
shade them with crimson lake in cake; cut a piece of fine
wire, two inches long, cut a strip of white wax, three quarters
of an inch in length, and pass it round one end of the wire.
This is to form the tube or foundation for the stamina to be
attached to: the latter are cut very fine from double lemon
wax. The anthers are tipped orange, the pistil green. Affix
the pistil and five stamina to each foundation, and then enclose
it in the tube or long part of the petals previously coloured,
as also in the white blossoms, first having passed a small
head pin twice or thrice down each. The tube is coloured
dark crimson, gradually softened off towards the upper end of
the blossom. A calyx is attached at the base of the tube in
the form of a small cup&mdash;a piece of double green wax, cut very
narrow, and passed once round. The buds are made solid:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
cut the wax, which must be double, in a triangular form; by
so doing, and winding the broadest end round the corresponding
end of the wire, the proper form will be easily accomplished,
without much assistance from the fingers. Unite
all the buds together first, and then place the blossoms round.
The leaves are placed on two and two.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE FUCHSIA;</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Fulgens;</span>) <i>Good taste:</i></h4></div>

<p class="noin">Will afford a pleasing variety to the flowers already described.
Its blossoms hang pendant like a tassel; it is both graceful in
form, and brilliant in colour: its construction is simple, being
formed from two patterns only. The smallest is cut in single
lemon wax, the largest in double wax, the same colour. The
four points of the largest pattern are tipped with green, and
shaded off with light scarlet towards the upper part of the
tube. It is not, however, entirely coloured until it is made,
as it is always difficult to unite a tube flower if it is painted
too close to the edge. The head of the curling pin is rolled
up each point upon the inside, and the tube formed with the
handle of a brush, joining the wax neatly upon one side.
After it is united, it is again painted with my scarlet powder
and a small portion of the crimson.</p>

<p>The small or inner petals are coloured upon both sides
with bright crimson only. The head of a large curling pin is
passed once down. The stamina are cut from double lemon wax,
a whip, as in muslin, being first rolled to produce the anthers;
these are touched with gum water, and, while wet, dipped into
cream colour powder, (produced by the combination of my
lemon and white.) The pistil is the same as the stamina,
only that it extends to a greater length: the stamina and
pistil are shaded very light scarlet. Cover a piece of fine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
wire, about four inches in length, with light green wax, mould
to the end a strip of lemon wax, to which affix first the pistil
and subsequently the stamina. Pass the wire through the
tube, and fix it firmly at the end; a narrow strip of double
light green wax placed once round the base of the tube completes
the whole. The buds are made solid, and formed
similarly to the honeysuckle; they are shaded green and
scarlet, like the flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE RED FUCHSIA;</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Fuchsia,</span>) <i>Taste:</i></h4></div>

<p class="noin">Is cut from white wax. It consists of four purple petals, and
four crimson; these are painted with the large brush upon
both sides, leaving a short space free from colour towards the
base of each. Cut the pistil and eight stamina as previously
directed, and colour them with crimson. To the end of these
may be observed in nature small particles of farina, this is
produced (as in the former instruction of fuchsia fulgens), by
dipping them while moistened with gum water into dry
powder. A foundation is formed at the end of a piece of fine
wire, the pistil attached, and the stamina encircling the same.
The four purple petals are then placed on to form a square,
having the head of the curling pin previously rolled down
each to cup them a little. The crimson or outer petals are
curled in like manner, and placed precisely at the corners
where the inner petals unite. The flower is now complete,
with the exception of the seed cup; but previous to this being
placed on, (which is merely a piece of green wax moulded into
the shape of a small berry,) the flower is coloured again
crimson, softening it off towards the said seed cup.</p>

<span class="rgt">Miller.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>This little flower is cut in one piece from thick white wax.
A hole is pierced in the centre with the curling pin. The
finest white wire is used: affix a small piece of wax to the
end, and fold it down with the wire; it must be very minute.
Pass it through the front of the flower, and fasten it at the
back by moulding it gently with the point of the pin. It is
painted after it is made: the centre is touched with a sable
brush&mdash;the colour, second yellow. The edges of the flower
are coloured a brilliant blue, for which use the light blue, with
minute portions of white and crimson. The buds and opening
flowers are more pink than the full-blown flowers.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>PINK GERANIUM.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Pelargonium.</span>) <i>Preference.</i></h4></div>

<p>Cut the petals in thick white wax; there are three narrow
and two broad. Mix a little white powder with some crimson,
and paint all the petals half way down lightly with this colour.
The brush must contain but a very small portion of colour, or
it would dry rough. The broad petals are afterwards coloured
as follows:&mdash;first vein the lower ends with cake smalt and
crimson, using for the purpose a fine sable brush. Then take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
a large brush, containing crimson alone, and form a large
round spot, gradually shading it off towards each edge. When
thoroughly dry, apply in the same manner the colour first used
for veining, leaving a light margin of the rose colour previously
laid on. With a sable brush paint some very faint pink veins,
extending from the spot towards (but not quite touching) the
ends of the petals. Some dark veins are laid on the spot also
with crimson powder and cake sepia. The middle size wire is
necessary to support the flower. Commence its construction
by affixing a strip of white wax about an inch down the same;
this is to represent the pistillum. Five very fine points extend
beyond the end of the wire, these are previously snipped with
the scissors; they are termed in botany the stigma. At the
base of the pistillum pass a strip of green wax; this is the
foundation to which the stamina and petals are to be attached.
The pistillum and stigma are painted entirely over with the
same colour previously used for veining. Cut five fine stamina
in white wax, to the points of each attach an anther, cut in
deep orange wax. They are placed across the end, and united
by pressing them together with the head of the curling pin.
Curl the broad petals by laying the painted side next the hand
and pressing the thumb into its centre. Upon the opposite
side at the lower end of the petal indent and round it with the
point of the pin. The small petals are similarly curled,
although it is necessary to vary them a little according to taste;
for upon observing nature it will be found that there is no
formality, in fact scarcely two petals or two flowers are precisely
the same upon a tree or stem. Attach the stamina to the
foundation, and then the two broad petals; finally, the three
narrowest are placed immediately under the stamina. The
calyx is cut from light green wax. The head of the pin is to
curl each previous to its being placed behind the petals. It
is shaded rather dark green towards the stem. Wash the
calyx over with a weak solution of gum water, and sprinkle it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
with down. In laying on the latter do not touch it with the
fingers, but throw it on from the bottle, and shake off all that
does not adhere.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>SCARLET GERANIUM.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Comforting.</i></h4></div>

<p>The petals are cut from thick white wax. Colour them
upon both sides with bright scarlet (scarlet and crimson both
in powders), form a very small foundation of white wax to the
end of a fine wire. Cut five fine and short stamina, place
them on the foundation, and colour them red. Affix the five
petals round, the two largest placed uppermost, the three
smaller ones under. Attach calyx as in the former flower.
Cover the stem neatly with light green wax, and mount the
flowers in clusters. Make some buds moulded in light green
wax, others in white wax, painted scarlet at the points; and
the calyx placed round as in the flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>MIGNONETTE.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Reseda Odorata.</span>) <i>Unconscious Beauty.</i></h4></div>

<p>It is a singular circumstance that in this country this
fragrant production of nature is known by a French name, the
translation of which is the "little darling," while in Paris it is
only known by its Latin appellation, <i>reseda</i>, (herb, or dock
cresses); but I believe I am correct in stating that its seeds were
first conveyed into England from Paris. It is not particularly
difficult to form, but requires extremely good sight, and a light
touch in its construction. It is of course made without a paper
pattern, and I would recommend a natural flower always to be
taken as a copy. It is also necessary to be very particular as
to the lemon tint used, the orange, and the shade of green, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
if the flower is formed correctly, it still looks unnatural if these
points are not materially considered.</p>

<p>Take a sheet of lemon wax, very thin and not too new;
cut directly from the corner six or eight fine filaments, as
pointed as possible; roll them into a small cluster. It
requires two clusters of this size, and two others nearly the
same, but shorter. Fold the end of a piece of lemon wax, and
snip (very short) a few stamina, which appear, when coloured,
like seed. The colour required is a sort of pinky orange, if I
may be allowed to use such a term; for which purpose I
employ my second orange, white, and a minute portion of
crimson powder: of course it requires some judgment as to
the several quantities. Commence the formation by attaching
a small piece of green wax to the end of a stem made from
white wire, mould it round according to nature; under this
place the cluster of orange seeds, on the top a small portion
of lemon wax, and at each corner the largest cluster of lemon
stamina; the smaller clusters place at the corners and under
the orange seeds. The calyx consists of five very narrow
strips of green wax, placed neatly and regularly at the back
of the flower. Cover the stem with very light green wax.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>ORANGE BLOSSOM.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Citrus.</span>) <i>Chastity.</i></h4></div>

<p>This is cut in double white wax. It consists of five petals.
The head of the small curling pin is passed up and down over
the whole of each; the petals are afterwards curled a little
with the fingers, to do away with any formality. A middle
size wire is used; pass a strip of white wax round, about half
an inch in length; press it broad at the end, and then place
a fringe of stamina twice round: colour the end of the pistil
and stamina with light orange. The petals are next affixed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
and a cup or calyx is formed at the base of light green wax.
The buds are moulded solid, round at the end, and pinched
up into rather an irregular form towards the base. The calyx
is finished off the same as the flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>SERINGA.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Counterfeit.</i></h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 17em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sweet seringa, yielding but in scent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the rich orange."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Cut the petals in white wax, double or thick; there are
but four to form the corolla. They are curled precisely like
the orange blossom. The centre is also similar to the last
named, only that there is no pistil or enlargement amongst the
stamina. The calyx consists of four points of double green
wax, indented with the pin, and tipped brown. Each point is
placed at the back of each petal.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>LILY.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Lilium Candidum.</span>) <i>Purity of heart.</i></h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Observe the rising lily's snowy grace."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Thomson.</span><br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The lily is an advantageous flower in a large group. The
one I am going first to notice is peculiar for its purity of
colour; it is very ornamental in a garden, and is much revered
in Catholic countries. Painters frequently place it in the
hands of the Virgin.</p>

<p>The petals, six in number, are cut from double white wax:
the broad or inner petals are curled as follows:&mdash;pass the
head of the smallest curling pin all over the petal to make it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
look slightly ribbed. Press the pin firmly up the centre to
make a distinct crease; turn the petal, and press against the
crease upon each side so as to form a groove. Return to the
former side, and again press the pin against the two outside
edges of the previously made creases; you will now have
produced two ribs or ridges. Pass the head of the pin round
the edge of the petal, to render it thin in appearance and to
stretch the same. This will also enable you to curl the petal
into form with the fingers, without splitting the edges. The
outer or narrow petals are curled similarly; but the slight
difference there exists between the two will be better understood
by taking a real flower to model from. Cover a piece of
middle size wire with light green wax, to represent the pistillum:
enlarge it with the same at the upper end to represent
the stigma; press it into a triangular form, and indent it with
the point of the pin. Six stamina are placed round; they are
each formed in the following manner:&mdash;cover a piece of fine
white wire with white wax, this is a filament; attach to the
end an anther, formed of bright orange wax, indent it strongly
across with the point of the pin. Wash it over with gum
water, and while it is in a state of moisture plunge it into the
orange coloured powder. The three largest petals are placed
on first, the three smaller or outer petals at the intervening
spaces.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE LILIUM LANCIFOLIUM.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Generous heart.</i></h4></div>

<p>The petals of this flower are curled similarly to the former,
but they bend back more in the form of a Turk's cap. There
is a narrow strip of bright yellow-green wax placed in the
centre, and at the lower end of each petal. The petals are
painted light pink (crimson and white), and covered with rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
crimson spots. The roughness at the lower end of each petal
is produced by cutting small pieces of double white wax, and
pressing them on with the head of the pin. The pistillum
and stamina are also formed in the same manner as the <i>lilium
candidum</i>, but vary in colour. The filaments of the stamina
are green, the anthers rich brown, produced with crimson and
cake sepia.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>WHITE WATER-LILY.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Nymphea Alba.</span>) <i>Eloquence.</i></h4>

</div></div></div>

<p>Commence the foundation of this flower by passing five
strips of double yellow wax round the end of a strong wire,
indenting the edge of each with the point of the curling pin,
and pressing the same into a flat surface: this foundation
must be about three quarters of an inch in diameter. Cut
sixteen strips of very deep orange wax (double), about the
tenth of an inch in width: place them round at equal distances.
Cut the pattern No. 1, in double yellow wax. Roll
the head of the curling pin in the broad part, and bend the
point of the same back. Place these on in rows of eight,
taking care that each row is between those preceding. The
petals are cut in thick white wax: cup them with the large
head ivory pin, to give them a rotundity of form; these are
all placed on in rows of four. Under the two or three largest
sets it is essential to place a small piece of white wire (covered
with wax), to support each petal. The four outside petals<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
are green externally and white within; this is accomplished
by pressing a sheet of thin green wax against the thick white.
They are shaded brown up the centre upon the green side,
using for the purpose the large brush, slightly moistened with
carmine and sepia. The stem requires to be thickly covered
with light green wax, shaded with brown, similar to the back
of the flower.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE YELLOW WATER-LILY.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Retirement.</i></h4></div>

<p class="noin">Is much more simple to form. It consists of only five petals;
these are cut in double yellow wax; colour them rather lightly
with green upon both sides, from the centre towards the base
of each. Curl the petals with the head of the large pin until
they become deeply cupped. The centre is much smaller than
that of the white lily&mdash;not exceeding in diameter the third of
an inch. The stamina are produced by cutting three or four
narrow strips of double yellow wax, and passing them round
the foundation; they must not extend above it, but when
brushed out form a full daisy-like centre. The five petals are
attached to the back of these, and the stem finished off as the
last.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE BLUE WATER-LILY;</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Warm affection;</i></h4></div>

<p class="noin">Forms a pleasing variety, but is not so generally well known,
from the fact of its requiring care in cultivation. Those
previously described may be seen blowing luxuriantly in common
ponds; but this I am about to give instruction upon I
have never seen except in a hot-house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Cut the petals in thick white wax; attach a fine white
wire half-way up the back of each. Colour them upon both
sides with light blue, or more properly speaking with blue
lavender. It is a peculiar shade of colour produced by mixing
the light blue powder with white and a minute portion of
crimson. Curl the petals with the head of a large curling pin,
by passing it firmly once down each centre. The four outside
petals are green at the back, and shaded rather darker up the
centre with the same colour. The centre is formed similar to
the white lily, but not so large. The stamina are cut also in
double yellow wax, and arranged regularly round in rows of
sixteen; three rows of these are sufficient. The petals are
placed on four in a row throughout the flower; the stem is
moderately thick and green.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>DAHLIA.</h3>

<h4>(<span class="smcap">Dahlia Purpurea.</span>) <i>Instability.</i></h4></div>

<p>Cut the required number of petals from pink wax&mdash;colour
them upon both sides with crimson. When quite dry, wash
them over lightly with bright purple (using for the purpose a
large brush, very moist.) When a second colour requires to
be laid on, I use a small portion of cake colour, (in the
present instance cake crimson, lake, with middle blue in
powder.) To curl the petals press the pin once down the
centre, upon the shining side; turn the petal, and press
against the same at the point, forming a melon-shaped section.
Fold the edges of the petal to meet at the lower end.</p>

<p>Make a foundation of two strips of double wax, taking
care to double in the wire. Indent it strongly with the pin
towards the point, as it must be pressed into a conical form:
it must be one inch deep and as much in circumference. Cut
three strips of double wax, vandyke them with the scissors,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and indent each point with the pin, bend the whole forward,
and paint them in the same manner and colour as the petals.
Pass these strips round the foundation first, keeping them
exactly the same height. Place three rows of petals on,
seven in number, then increase them to nine in a row, and so
continue until the flower is complete. Take care to place
every petal between and not behind its predecessors, and let
each row fall back, so that at the conclusion it has a globular
appearance in front, and flat at the back of the flower. Cut
the calyx in double wax; it consists of ten points, five are
light green, attached to the back of the flower, and five dark
sepals which are pendant round the stem.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE SALVIA PATENS.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Rich and Rare.</i></h4></div>

<p>This flower is of so rich and lovely a hue, that for its
colour alone it deserves imitation. There are but few decidedly
blue flowers, and I do not myself know any one that
approaches this for brilliancy; it is however useful in consequence
of its form being light and spray-like. The petals
require to be cut in double blue wax; the shape must be
produced previously to the colour being laid on. Petals cut
from pattern No. 1, are much rolled with the pin and neatly
united up the back. Take a piece of middle size wire, with a
small piece of wax secured at the end, and pass it through the
opening of the tube just formed. The under or banner petal
is formed by pressing it in the palm of the hand; turn up the
edges of the broad end of the petal, and turn down the edges
of the narrow part; at the same time I must mention that a
small wire is placed between this petal, by which it is affixed
to its position. The buds are formed in the same manner as
the flower, with the exception of the banner petal. The calyx<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
consists of two points or sepals, attached one under and the
other opposite the tube. The whole is painted with deep rich
blue, produced by mixing cake smalt with the middle blue in
powder. They are mounted in a spray by placing buds and
flowers down the stem, two facing each other, and arranged
alternate ways. A green leaf is placed under each bud and
blossom.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>VARIEGATED CAMELLIA.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Unpretending excellence.</i></h4>

<div class="poem" style="width: 21em;"><div class="stanza">

<span class="rgt">J. G. Percival.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the limits of this little work will not admit of my giving
instruction in more than one of these favourite flowers, I
select the variegated one, considering it the most difficult.</p>

<p>The petals require to be cut in thick wax; colour them
upon both sides with bright crimson, leaving white circular
spots indiscriminately in various parts of two petals out of
every five. The largest petals are formed by pressing the
thumb very firmly upon the shining side, taking care that the
edge inclines back without any wrinkled appearance. A
crease is made up the centre upon the opposite side. Each
set of petals are painted and curled the same, but the smallest
are folded together. The stamina must be prepared from pale
lemon wax, (cut double,) and the anthers at the end tipped
with orange powder to represent the farina; they are cut into
small clusters of seven or eight. Use the large wire,&mdash;pass a
piece of double wax, the width of a sheet, and half an inch in
depth, round the wire,&mdash;about half an inch deep; bend the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
wire down, and mould the whole into a cone shape. Affix a
small cluster of stamina to the point, and in various directions
the five smallest petals; insert among these two or three
clusters of the stamina. Place in rows of five each succeeding
set of petals, taking care in each row to introduce about
two of the variegated or spotted petals, allowing such to be
principally upon one side of the flower (and this may be
observed in nearly all flowers that are variegated.)</p>

<p>The calyx is cut from lemon wax, shaded green and also
brown. The head of the pin is rolled upon each to cup it:
they are placed immediately behind the flower in rows of
three, each succeeding set in the intervening spaces.</p>

<p>The stem is covered with a strip of light green wax,
moulded smooth with the thumb and finger, tinged brown
with the brush.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE PASSION FLOWER;</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Belief:</i></h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p style="text-indent: -1em;">"Has become strangely interwoven with our faith, from a fancied
resemblance to a cross and a crown, although it requires a great
effort of the imagination to call up either the one or the other.
Still its very name in some measure renders it sacred to faith
and belief."</p></div></div>

<p>Cut the petals, ten in number, from treble wax, one of
white and two of lemon; colour the lemon side with light
green, leaving the edge rather lighter. Curl each petal in the
following manner: press it in the hand, while warm, that the
three thicknesses of wax may be certain to adhere. Roll the
head of the small pin once down the centre upon the white
side, and round the edge also. This must be done lightly at
first, for if a pin is pressed too heavily it occasions the sheets
of wax to separate and have a blistered appearance. Cut<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
three triangular pieces of double wax, one inch in length,
place the broad end to a piece of fine wire, and mould them
smoothly down, small at the base and broad at the point;
these three are affixed to the end of a middle size wire, and
painted purple after they are attached. A piece of light green
wax is moulded round immediately under them; about a
quarter of an inch from this is attached the stamina, cut in
light green wax, and touched round the ladle shape end with
my orange powder. A full inch from this is placed a small
foundation, formed of strips of green wax, two of which are
snipped and coloured purple. The rays are attached immediately
afterwards, and are manufactured as follows:&mdash;cut
a number of strips of white wax, roll them between the fingers
to incline them to be round; place your pieces of marble in
warm water, and finish rolling the said strips of wax or rays
between them: this is a much quicker, easier, and cleaner
process than by doing them entirely with the fingers. Cut
a strip of double green wax to pattern, place it about three
quarters of an inch from the edge of a folded paper, place each
of the rays closely upon this, taking care that every point
extends only to the paper; this method will enable you to
place them perfectly even, which is very necessary. For a
flower it requires two strips of these rays; they are painted
blue at the point and purple at the base, leaving a corresponding
space white between the two colours. Press the two
strips neatly round the previously made foundation, bending
them back and regulating them with the point of the curling-pin.
I next attach five petals at equal distance, the longest
and narrowest of the two sets are placed on first, the other
five immediately between. The calyx is cut in light green
wax, it consists of three sepals, which are rolled with the head
of the pin and attached to the back of the flower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>LEMON HOLLYHOCK.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Persuasion.</i></h4></div>

<p>This flower should be constructed of very thin lemon wax.
It requires thirty small petals and seven large for a full blown
flower: each petal is shaded with the light yellow powder
towards the lower end. Crimp each petal with the point of
the curling pin, and fold one end forward, the other back.
Pass a strip of double lemon wax round the end of a piece of
middle size wire, and mould the same to a point; the thirty
small petals are attached first, so as to form a full rosette.
The large petals are affixed to the back, and finished off with
the calyx of double green. Half blown flowers are formed
the same, but cut from smaller patterns. The early buds are
moulded solid of green wax, covered with lemon; the calyx is
placed on similar to the flower, moistened with gum water and
sprinkled with down. Pink hollyhocks may be made precisely
the same, the only difference being that pink wax and colour
must be substituted for lemon.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE CACTUS.</h3>

<h4 class="hd3"><i>Warmth.</i></h4></div>

<p>Cut the petals in bright orange wax, place a fine white wire
half way up each, and occasion it to adhere by attaching a
strip of orange wax over it. Colour them upon both sides
with carmine. Curl the petals by passing the head of the pin
twice or thrice from each edge towards the centre, and bend
the same back. Fold down the edge or end of two sheets of
thick white wax. Leave a quarter of an inch from the end
quite white, then paint a pink stripe half an inch deep; leave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
again a quarter of an inch white, and finally finish with a
stripe of green. Cut the whole two widths into a deep fringe
to form the stamina, and colour the anthers (produced by the
fold) with cream colour (white and lemon powders). Take a
piece of middle size wire, pass round it a strip of white wax;
this is to form the pistillum. Attach to the end five fine
points of white wax, and paint them also cream colour; shade
the filament of the pistillum red. Divide the stamina, attach
half to the upper, and the remainder to the three under petals.
Join the pistillum to a strong stem, passing white wax round
to form a foundation. Affix to the foundation the six petals,
to which are attached the stamina, letting the latter fall from
the top petals over the lower ones, and dividing it so as to
enable the pistillum to pass through. Every set of petals are
placed precisely between those preceding until the flower is
complete. It must be remembered that the largest petals are
attached first, and that they gradually decrease until you
arrive at the smallest.</p>

</div></div>

<div class="hd2"><h3>GROUPING FLOWERS.</h3></div>

<p>One of the principle rules to be observed is to avoid placing
those flowers together which approach the same form or colour.
Thus, in arranging two round flowers, I invariably break the
formality by introducing some light spray. To facilitate a
taste for grouping is the cause of my introducing illustrations
to this work. It will be observed that I arrange spring
flowers always alone. I am not so particular with the flowers
of every season, for art in cultivation has done so much in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
furnishing us with specimens of various seasons, that it is no
uncommon thing to meet with a rose in spring that we should
take for</p>

<p class="center">"The last rose of summer."</p>

<p>In the florists' windows, in winter (I mean in Covent
Garden), we may perceive such perfections of nature that our
imagination might be tempted to suppose that the summer sun
could alone have produced them.</p>

<p>I would recommend the early spring flowers to be arranged
in flower pots or in wicker baskets. In mixed groups, as a
certain guide to those who do not like to trust to their own
taste for blending colours, I would place lavender near pink;
blue to red; white should approximate to scarlet, and yellow
to purple. The small flowers particularly essential in separating
the larger ones are white and yellow jasmine, nemophila
cineraria, verbenas, myrtle, honeysuckle, etc., etc. The
pendent flowers give great ease and elegance to a bouquet,
and should be placed in first. The neck of the vase should
be well filled with dried moss, which can be procured at the
herbalists. Alabaster and glass vases are best adapted for the
reception of wax bouquets, except when they are intended for
the centre of a table, and then I prefer baskets of alabaster,
wicker, or gilt; glass shades are requisite to cover either.
All, or any of the last-named articles, I shall be happy to furnish
to those who may kindly think proper to favour me with
orders, addressed to my residence, 35, Rathbone Place.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>WAX FLOWERS, AS ORNAMENTS FOR THE HAIR,</h3></div>

<p class="noin">Have become so generally worn at Her Majesty's balls and
drawing-rooms, that I deem it expedient to give some particular<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
instructions respecting them, so as to insure their durability
and prevent their adhesion to the hair.</p>

<p>For the first point named, I attach a fine white wire half
way up the back of each petal; this materially strengthens
the flower. All white flowers should be sprinkled with my
prepared arrowroot, this prevents the edges of the petals clinging
to the hair, and is a protection against heat. In coloured
flowers, the paint has the same effect. The stems are to be
covered with narrow ribbon, green or brown (China ribbon).
When the flowers are to be perfumed, the perfume is to be
placed upon the ribbon.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>INSTRUCTIONS FOR MODELLING FOLIAGE.</h3></div>

<p>There are various ways of modelling leaves, but I would
recommend them to be made of sheet wax as much as possible.
Take three sheets of green wax, matching in colour the leaf
you are about to imitate. It is not material whether the
middle sheet is the same colour as the upper or under sheet.
Cover a wire,&mdash;the size must be chosen according to the proportion
of the leaf,&mdash;place the said wire when covered under
one sheet&mdash;cut the wax into the form of the leaf required.
Plunge the real leaf into cold water, and the wax into hot;
while in a softened state press it firmly and quickly upon the
wrong side of the real leaf. This will give a truthful imitation.
If a real leaf cannot be obtained of any particular
flower, they can be modelled from a plaister mould, which I
shall be happy to furnish.</p>

<p>Another method is to melt a small quantity of green wax
into a liquid state. With a broad flat brush wash over the
wrong side of a real leaf, previously oiled with the best
salad oil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>The latter method may be also adopted upon a mould,
soaked in warm water ten minutes previous to its being used.</p>

<p>The stalk must be attached afterwards, and a second layer
of wax placed over.</p>

<div class="hd2"><h3>THE VICTORIA REGIA.</h3>

<p class="center">"There is a splendour in the living flower."</p></div>

<p>Cut the petals from my peculiarly prepared wax; attach
a wire half way up each at the back; colour the first sixteen
petals with pale lemon. The remaining petals require a faint
glow of pink laid on from the base towards the centre. They
must be all much moulded with the large ivory curling pin,
as well as assisted by the thumb and finger. The sixteen
petals which constitute the two first rows, and which have
been tinted pale lemon, have a deep pink vandyke or point
formed at the lower end of each; round the edge of this point
must be laid numerous spots and strokes of rich crimson,
produced with crimson lake and minute portions of blue.
Eight of the last named petals are shaded darker than the
others, and are placed on first.</p>

<p>The centre or foundation is formed by moulding wax into
a solid substance, two inches in diameter and three-quarters of
an inch in depth. The stamina are very numerous, and cut
according to patterns. The points are crimson, then shaded
lemon, and rich pink the lower end. They are curled by
passing the head of the curling pin firmly down the centre,
bending the points a little back. The first four rows should
fall down over the foundation, the other stand erect; by this
means a direct crown is formed which contributes in a great
measure to the beauty of the flower. The petals are placed
on in rows of eight, with the exception of the last four, or as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
they may be termed, sepals of the calyx. These are at the
back or outside dark chocolate colour (I prepare a wax on
purpose). The large green seed cup that is finally attached
is cast in hot wax, and can be purchased either at my establishment,
or at my counters, Soho Bazaar. The calyx and
seed cup are covered with prickles: to form these, roll some
shreds or strips of light green wax between the marbles
moderately warm; sever them into small pieces; hold the
thickest end to a lighted candle, and apply each quickly to its
proper place.</p>

<p>In selecting this flower as the closing subject of my instructions,
it may not be entirely devoid of interest to many
of my pupils to be furnished with a brief detail of the derivation
of its name and character, as also the place where this
extraordinary production of nature was first discovered. Sir
R. Schomburgk was travelling in British Guiana, in the year
1837. It was in the River Berbice he beheld it, or I may
say them, for numbers were floating in all their pride and
glorious beauty, and at once struck him with surprise from
the majesty of their form, and brilliancy of colour. This
plant flowered first in England, at Chatsworth, the seat of
the Duke of Devonshire, and soon after was named "Victoria,"
by the gracious permission of her Majesty.</p>

<p>Mr. Paxton has publicly stated, that his design for the
Crystal Palace originated in consequence of his having
planned the house in which was grown the first specimen of
this gigantic plant at Chatsworth. Thus its name will be
immortalized in connexion with that of the Exhibition till
time immemorial. I think it may be justly denominated an
emblem of strength and power.</p>

<p>Before I entirely leave this subject, I cannot resist alluding
to the circumstance of my withdrawing works of great magnitude
(and which I had purposely prepared for competition),<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
from the late great Exhibition. It is due also to the gentlemen
who formed the executive committee that a true statement
should be made respecting their exclusion. A rumour having
been circulated that they (the gentlemen of the executive
committee), refused to give me adequate space, I am anxious
to repudiate such statements, and to acknowledge that some
of my best patronesses previously to the opening of the Great
Exhibition, and since that period, have been various members
of the families of those gentlemen and the Royal commissioners.
Ample space was allotted to me in the gallery, and it was
considered that as other wax flowers were to be arranged there,
mine would not suffer more than the rest; but the gentleman,
and I believe the only person who had anything to do with
the arrangement of mine, was Mr. Owen Jones. I acquit this
gentleman of any invidious feeling towards me, but can only
regret that he did not personally inspect my works. If he
had, I feel persuaded he would have been amazed at their
magnitude and the bulk of labour executed by myself unassisted.
As it is, it is more than probable that I suffer in the
opinion of some, to the effect that I showed some degree of
"temper" or obstinacy in withdrawing them.</p>

<div class="hd1"><p class="inde">I am likewise anxious that it should be known that it was
not the heat of the gallery entirely that intimidated me. My
plates of bent glass were much larger than any in the Crystal
Palace, and the groups were arranged upon thirty hundred
weight of stone. The whole formed such a huge mass that it
was deemed by scientific men to be impracticable to be elevated
to the gallery, without jeopardising what had been produced
by me by intense labour and profuse expense. The truth of
this statement can be testified by an examination of the works,

<h2 class="pub1"><small>EXHIBITION OF</small><br />
WAX FRUITS AND FLOWERS,<br />
<small>BY MRS. PEACHEY,</small><br />
<small><small><small>ARTISTE TO HER MAJESTY.</small></small></small></h2>

<p>The following eloquent awards of the press are placed as
nearly as possible in the order of their respective dates, but
the dates are necessarily omitted.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Peachey, artiste to her Majesty, has now on private view
at her rooms, 35, Rathbone Place, a superb collection of works
intended for the Great Exhibition. They consist principally of an
enormous bouquet of flowers and a colossal vase of fruit, both of
which have been executed upon a scale never previously attempted
in this country. The flowers are so arranged, that they appear to
stand in a basket suspended over the surface of a pool of limpid
water, in which the <i>Victoria Regia</i> and other similar plants are
already floating. Nothing can be more exquisite or artistic in effect
than the manner in which the various flowers are grouped. The
bouquet comprises specimens of almost every flower known to the
botanist, from the simple honeysuckle of the cottage garden, to the
rarest and most valuable exotics of the East.</p>

<p>Some idea of the dimensions of the two principal works may be
gathered from the fact, that the shades are nearly six feet high, the
largest ever blown in England, and the flowers occupied nearly a
year in modelling. It was the intention of Mrs. Peachey to forward
these beautiful specimens of her skill to the Great Exhibition,
where a prominent place on the ground-floor was assigned to them;
but it appears, that, owing to subsequent arrangements, another
space, in one of the galleries, was allotted to her, and not at all
adapted to such costly and fragile productions. The heat of the
sun, in such an exposed situation, would have damaged the flowers
irreparably; and even if this objection did not exist, it would be
impossible to have the enormous shades, with their delicate contents,
raised by any machinery at command into the desired position.
The exhibition is one of so novel and beautiful a character, that it
will well repay a visit.&mdash;<i>Morning Post.</i></p></div>

<hr />
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot"><p>The art of making flowers in wax has been brought to a very
high degree of perfection by Mrs. Peachey, Her Majesty's artiste.
There is not a floral production that she cannot truthfully and
delicately reproduce with her kindly material, and she has lately
executed a work which we believe defies competition in the department
to which it belongs. This is an enormous bouquet, containing
flowers of the most intricate structure, and supported by a rock,
which peers from a lake of the brightest looking glass, decorated
in its turn with waxen aquatic plants. All the flowers were
modelled in the first instance from white wax, and the beautiful
colours are all produced by painting. The whole group is enclosed
by a shade, composed of four glass plates, so curved as to meet at
the top.</p>

<p>The work in question is to be seen in Rathbone Place, but it
was the intention of Mrs. Peachey that it should be seen at the
Crystal Palace. According to her statement, she was led to believe
that she would be allowed a ground-floor situation, but was only
allowed a place in the gallery, so exposed to the sun, that the first
hot day would have performed a work precisely the reverse of her
own labours. Under these circumstances she has deemed it better
that her flowers should blush unseen, than that they should melt
away in a halo of visibility.</p>

<p>Into the Crystal controversy it is not our desire to enter, but
we would testify to the excellence of Mrs. Peachey's work as being
perfect of its kind.&mdash;<i>The Times.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>We yesterday inspected a beautiful collection of wax flowers by
Mrs. Peachey, artiste to Her Majesty, now on private view at 35,
Rathbone Place. We have seen many specimens of the elegant art
of modelling in wax, but without exaggeration we may declare that
more magnificent and truthful imitations of nature it has never been
our lot to witness. The centre-piece is an immense bouquet of
several hundred flowers, of almost every description, and every hue,
from the gorgeous scarlet cactus to the virgin-tinted snowdrop,
modelled with the closest fidelity, and arranged with exquisite taste.
At the foot are models of the glorious water-lily of Guyana, the
recently discovered Victoria Regia, in several stages of its development,
from the close shut bud with its prickly calyx to the expanded
flower. Some idea of the dimensions of this giant bouquet may be
formed from the fact that it stands nearly six feet in height, and
that the bent plate-glass shade with which it is covered alone cost
&pound;200.</p>

<p>Next to this in beauty as well as size is a vast group of fruit,
fifty inches in height, the shade to which is itself a curiosity, being
we believe, the largest for superficial dimensions ever yet blown in
England. Besides, there are a number of smaller groups of flowers
and fruit, all of singular beauty. We understand that Mrs. Peachey
intended this collection for exhibition at the Crystal Palace; but,
owing to some miscomprehension on the part of the commission,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
they have been reserved for private view. The place assigned to
Mrs. Peachey was, we are informed, in one of the galleries, so close
to the roof as to render the solar heat too dangerous for the extremely
susceptible material of which these articles are composed.&mdash;<i>Morning
Advertiser.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Peachey, the artiste to her Majesty, has on view at her
residence, 35, Rathbone Place, some new examples of her extraordinary
skill in wax painting, originally intended for the Exhibition,
but not permitted to appear there in consequence of the <i>locale</i>
assigned to them being at the top of the building, where, exposed
to the action of the sun, they would be in peril of dissolution. The
examples consist of two remarkable models&mdash;one an enormous and
magnificent bouquet, consisting of hundreds of flowers of the most
intricate structure and beautiful colouring, as well as the greatest
diversity of character. The violet and the <i>Cactus grandiflora</i>, with
the water-lily of Guiana, and the newly discovered <i>Victoria regia</i>,
form part of this exquisite group.</p>

<p>All the flowers were modelled separately from white wax, and
the colours afterwards superinduced. The bouquet stands six feet
in height, and is covered with a bent glass shade. The other model
is a group of fruitage, covered with a glass shade more than four
feet high, and nearly three feet across, being the largest ever yet
blown in England. It was manufactured from designs supplied by
Mrs. Peachey herself, and cost &pound;200. Nothing can be more picturesque
or artistic than these models: full of wonderful detail
which it is impossible to pursue, and implying a marvellous amount
of labour and ingenuity, they lead us to regret that any misunderstanding
should have led to their absence from the Crystal Palace.&mdash;<i>Illustrated
London News.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Ever willing to extend our protecting &aelig;gis to the weak and
unsupported, we feel ourselves called upon at the present juncture
to step into the arena as the defenders of several meritorious individuals
whom we conceive to have met with the most unworthy
treatment in regard to the exhibition, or rather the non-exhibition
of their productions of art in the Crystal Palace. We have
received a number of communications from artists of first-rate
talent, complaining of the exercise of undue influence in official
quarters, but we have been more immediately led into an investigation
of the circumstances connected therewith, by a communication
from Mrs. Peachey, of No. 35, Rathbone Place, Oxford Street,
artiste in wax to Her Majesty. That lady's statement is nearly as
follows:&mdash;that about twelve months ago, when the erection of the
building in Hyde Park was spoken of, and the nature of its contents
mentioned, she, feeling anxious to prove to the world that the very
high and royal patronage she enjoyed was not unmerited, sent in
her subscription of five guineas towards the construction of the
building, and intimated her intention of sending in some specimens<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
of her own works. She was immediately assigned a most elegant
site for her display on the ground floor, in the avenue near the
fountain.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more consonant to her wishes, and she forthwith
sent in her pedestals and minor portions of framework, etc.
Some time since, however, on questioning this gentleman as to the
certainty of her getting the desired position, she was astonished at
being told she must send her articles to No. 29, <i>in the gallery</i>.
This she refused to do, and the consequence has been that the
Exhibition has been deprived of some of its rarest specimens of art.
The reason Mrs. Peachey assigns for not sending her works to the
gallery is the impracticability of their being carried up stairs without
being, from their extreme fragility, seriously injured, perhaps
mutilated. Even were they to be slung up by tackle, she says they
would be subject to the same risk, and her two principal works,
viz.&mdash;an enormous bouquet of the most exquisitely modelled flowers,
and a gigantic vase of fruit, she values at no less a sum than
&pound;1000.&mdash;<i>Sunday Times.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>A visit to Rathbone-place, is a stepping from the ordinary exhibitions
of mere art to a miniature garden, in which may be seen
grouped together the beautiful flowers and fruits of every season
and every clime. We shall not attempt to describe with too
nice minuteness the wonderful creations of this gifted lady's hand,
but freely give our impressions as they came on our inspection of
these completions&mdash;these perfections of art.</p>

<p>To name all the blushing subjects so fairly representing the rich
and wide domain of Flora, would be far less easy of accomplishment,
of enumeration, than to say that queen roses&mdash;the English
rose&mdash;the delicate, the beautifully clothed lily&mdash;the crimson fuchsia&mdash;the
acacia, and gorgeous tulip&mdash;the Victoria Regia, in all its
stages of development, bud, blossom, flower,&mdash;were as the realities
of stilly life, which seemed to say, in the expressive language of
flowers&mdash;"put aside from us our glassy veils, remove our crystal
shrines, that we may nod kisses to the wooing zephyrs."</p>

<p>Pomona, too, was there. Her thousand fruits clustered under
transparent concaves. Grapes that might have moved Bacchus to
press them with his rosy lips&mdash;peaches, melons, shiny currants, inviting
strawberries, and crowning pineapples&mdash;all worthy the pencil
of a Lance&mdash;glorious as the painting of nature, mockingly tempted
us to seize the fairy prizes&mdash;reminding us of an anecdote of Swift.
The facetious dean, with several friends, was invited to walk the
rounds, and admire the delicious fruit bending the countless trees
to the earth in the orchard of an "old acquaintance," who kindly
pointed out to his most admiring guests the charming sweets by
which they were surrounded; but, "sour grapes to them"&mdash;asked
them not to make themselves "at home," nor offered pear nor
apple. This was too much for Swift, who had a happy knack of
inventing scraps of poetry to suit his purposes, and thus applied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
himself on the occasion; "I remember that my old grandmother
had a saying:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Always take a peach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When within your reach."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">Action suited to the words quickly followed. The quick arch wit
of St. Patrick's put forth his hand, and his good example was
followed by all the company, who each took a peach, when within
his reach. Now, we must confess that we were almost tempted to
essay a similar feat of onslaught on Mrs. Peachey's magic garden,
but were, fortunately for all future sight-seers, withheld by the
consciousness that those many rainbow liveried sweets to the eye,
were not for ourselves or Covent-garden, but were the triumphs
of a skilful artiste.</p>

<p>And are these the works that have been, which are refused a
fitting place in the high field of universal, peaceful rivalry and
competition in the Crystal Palace for the works <i>of all nations</i>?
What! Can this be possible? Here are the works <i>of our own
nation not there</i>&mdash;excluded! Surely for the credit of the Exhibition&mdash;for
the honorable name of the Executive Committee, there
should be enquiry. The works cannot be said to be excluded upon
their merits, for they have not been inspected by the authorities.
There was, nay, there is room enough in the building in Hyde Park
for this peerless and costly challenge of an English woman as an
artiste. England in fair competition against the world! We looked
for these gems of art in the Crystal Hall&mdash;but found them only in
the catalogue! We asked where they were, and the nymph Echo
answered "where!" If there be any unworthy motive for this, to
us, incomprehensible exclusion of native art, let such be dissipated
by the breath of public opinion. But we would fain persuade ourselves
that there must be some misapprehension. The works of a
lady&mdash;patronized by the Queen, to be excluded from an Exhibition
open to the people of all nations&mdash;we cannot comprehend it; but
for the honour and fame of the nation, hope to see in their proper
places, works daily visited, and admired by the aristocracies of rank,
wealth, and refined taste.</p>

<p>Mrs. Peachey has spared neither pains nor expense, the glass
flower-shade having cost her &pound;200; she has contributed to the
Exhibition, and exhibits freely. The press has noticed the emanations
of her genius, and we add our testimony.&mdash;<i>West Kent
Guardian.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>And before passing from the wax flower group, we may add an
expression of our regret, that differences of some kind prevented
its including the very magnificent case and bouquet which had been
prepared by Mrs. Peachey, one of the artistes in wax to her Majesty.
The stand itself, which, with its contents, was on private view, is
externally, more elegant than any of the cases in the Exhibition,
and the flowers would have yielded to none in variety or brilliancy
of tint. The reputation of Mrs. Peachey, whose artistic talent is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
of a first-rate description, would have justified the authorities in
some concession, and would have enriched this department of the
Exhibition with a feature of no ordinary beauty.&mdash;<i>Illustrated London
News.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have inspected, at the private residence of Mrs. Peachey
(in Rathbone Place, Oxford Street,) artiste in wax-work to Her
Majesty, one of the most remarkable specimens of ingenuity and
industry which London at present contains. This is an immense
bouquet of wax flowers which that lady had prepared for the
Crystal Palace, but which are not at present within its walls, for a
reason to which we will presently advert. Let us first describe this
really magnificent work. On four sturdy stone columns, tastefully
designed, and edged with gold, is a looking-glass platform upwards
of four-feet square, and representing water. From the centre of
this fairy lake rises a glass column supporting a golden basket. In
this is placed a bouquet some two feet high, and of proportionate
girth, in which are clustered all the flowers we ever saw, and a
great many which we never saw&mdash;from the humble favorites of our
<i>Rigolettes</i> and <i>Fleur de Maries</i>, up to the floral aristocracy of the
conservatory. There they are exquisitely reproduced in all their
graces of form and colour, and arranged with the attention to contrast
and general effect which bespeaks the superintending eye of
the real artist. We are afraid to say how many hundred wax
flowers compose this splendid bouquet; but we can safely say that,
after having walked round and round it, and, as we thought, having
completely examined it, the eye continually insisted on detecting
some new variety, and we finally abandoned the hope of ever becoming
acquainted with the whole. From the corners of the imitative
waters rise various superb specimens of water plants, fresh,
cool, opaque-looking, productions; and at the foot of the glass
column, as if planted by accident, spring a few of our more common
and very beautiful garden flowers. The whole is covered by an
enormous bent glass shade, from the centre of which rises a pretty
copy of Her Majesty's crown. Nothing can be more beautiful or in
better taste than the object we have described. Near it is another
vase, not so large, and filled with wax fruit of every kind&mdash;the
bloom of the grape, the blush of the apple, the rich brown of the
nut, the velvet of the apricot, the glow of the orange, and the
characteristics of a hundred other fruits being represented with a
tantalizing fidelity. We would have flogged the fellow who broke
the Portland Vase, but we did not feel so sure, while gazing upon
these admirable imitations of the most delicious fruits, that we
should have been so severe upon some earnest gourmand who
might dash down the vase of which we speak, in wrath that his eye
and his palate had been so nobly cheated. The two vases, one of
flowers, the other of fruits, are certainly the most sumptuous specimens
of wax composition we ever saw.</p>

<p>As we have said, these works were intended by Her Majesty's
artiste for the Great Exhibition. On her applying for a site, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
lady states that a very admirable one was assigned her upon the
ground-floor of the building, near the fountains. Upon her work
being complete, she was directed to place it in the gallery. This,
Mrs. Peachey considered would be to jeopardise it, from the danger
so fragile a production would probably sustain in being taken up
stairs, and still more from the heat of the sun, to which the wax
would in that situation be exposed, and which would speedily produce
Icarian results destructive to the work.&mdash;<i>Bell's Weekly Messenger.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Two groups of flowers and fruit most tastefully and elaborately
executed in wax by Mrs. Peachey, of Rathbone Place, have, we
regret to say, been withdrawn from the Crystal Palace in consequence
of an inappropriate position having been assigned them by
the Committee. Mrs. Peachey, who stands unrivalled in this class of
ornamental art, feeling herself aggrieved by the decision of the committee,
has appealed from it to the judgment of the public, and with
that view has placed her works in an apartment of her residence, 35,
Rathbone Place, for inspection. The taste, the labour, the time
bestowed on these magnificent works, must have been very great,
and we fancy the visitors to the Crystal Palace will be greater losers
by their absence from that repository than even the fair artiste
herself, for they are deemed by all who have seen them the finest
works of the kind ever executed.&mdash;<i>Morning Herald.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have several times during the past week inspected, with
much gratification a magnificent bouquet of the most rare exotics,
as also a large collection of grouped fruits, modelled entirely in
wax, by Mrs. Peachey, Her Majesty's artiste in ordinary in that department
of feminine accomplishment, and intended by that lady
for competition in "the World's Fair." We have often had occasion
to witness the extraordinary skill displayed by this lady in
imitating the beauties of nature from her kindly materials, but
we must confess (although previously informed that the present
works outvied all the previous attempts of the artiste) that we were
unprepared for designs and executions so exquisitely chaste and
artistic, and true in the imitation of nature. What could have
induced the executive committee of the Great Exhibition to decide
upon excluding works of such elaborate labour and beauty, and
these the works of an English artist, of the first standing, we are
totally at a loss to conjecture. We say "excluding," for it is
tantamount to exclusion to tell Mrs. Peachey that she must place
such volatile work in a top gallery, exposed to the heat of a July
sun, or withdraw them, although she had been previously allocated
space on the basement of the building. Mrs. Peachey adopted the
latter alternative, feeling it detrimental to her works, not only from
the objectionable position assigned her, but also from the impossibility
of having her cases, which are of a large size, conveyed into
the gallery, without materially injuring designs of so fragile a nature.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>It is to be regretted that Mrs. Peachey should be thus compelled
to adopt a measure which has deprived the Exhibition of one
of its rarest specimens of art, specimens which we are certain
would severely test, if not outvie,&mdash;all other competitors in that
department. We are glad to know, however, that the artiste's
credit will not suffer from this harsh exclusion. The labour, skill,
and expense she has bestowed are already duly appreciated by a
discerning public, thousands of the <i>elite</i> of the aristocracy and
gentry having already visited Mrs. Peachey at her residence in
Rathbone-place, all of whom have expressed the most unequivocal
satisfaction and delight at the beauty of the specimens, which, they
allege, are far superior to any in the Exhibition. We ourselves
strongly recommend our fair readers to inspect these inimitable
works, feeling certain that they will continue to be pronounced the
finest works of the kind ever executed.&mdash;<i>Observer.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>The complaints against the partiality and want of discrimination
on the part of the executive committee of the Great Exhibition in
the allotment of space to the would-be exhibitors are of daily and
hourly recurrence. Among the grievances which are more especially
injurious to the thorough development of British industry
in the more delicate and refined art in feminine accomplishments,
we may mention the case of Mrs. Peachey, of Rathbone-place, the
"warranted" wax florist to Her Most Gracious Majesty. This
lady, one of the earliest claimants for pedestal space, on the first
announcement of the intended Congregation of the Industry of
All Nations, we think, has been most harshly dealt by. Her first
application was duly answered, and an allotment made her of space
on the basement of the building near one of the fountains, and
amongst the other gems of art. Subsequently, privately, she ascertained
that some alteration was made with reference to her contributions;
and, on application, it was intimated to her that, in
consequence of "want of room," the executive had determined on
transferring her cases to class 29, situated in one of the galleries.
Mrs. Peachey, on inspecting the location, objected, on the just plea
that wax flowers were liable to atmospheric influence from the great
heat accruing from the glass roof and plate glass surrounding her
flowers; and also their material and serious injury from the impracticability
of moving her compositions, composed entirety of
wax, up staircases without injuring her designs. The whole has
resulted in the total exclusion of one of the most beautiful contributions,
designed and arranged by one of our most honoured
and worthy British Artists. Since Mrs. Peachey's exclusion has
been known, her studio has been visited by the most aristocratic
of the nobility and gentry, who have expressed the utmost indignation
at her exclusion from the great competition in the World's
Fair. The contributions, which occupy a small space, consist of
the most rare exotic and indigenous flowers and fruits, which so
closely imitate nature as nearly to deceive the spectator, and give<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
him a desire to take and taste of the luscious banquet. Altogether
the cases, which occupied her twelve months in completing, are
worthy of inspection, a gratification which Mrs. Peachey affords
the public by throwing open her rooms for public inspection. We
recommend the admirers of imitative art to inspect these beautiful
and artistic gems.&mdash;<i>Expositor.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>A visit to Mrs. Peachey's Studio, in Rathbone-place, is like
stepping into some garden of Fairy Land, where flowers of all
seasons, and fruits of every clime present themselves at once to the
eye in perennial bloom. The rose is there in all its varieties, the
lily, the drooping fuchsia, the accasia, the gorgeous tulip, the
dahlia, the Victoria Regia in all its stages of development, bud,
blossom, flower. Grapes, too, that would have moved the jolly
god to press them within his ruddy lips, peaches, nectarines,
currants, strawberries, and crowning pine apples, in one rare
trophy, worthy the study of a Lance. Our feelings at the moment
recalled vividly an amusing anecdote of Swift. The facetious
Dean with several friends was invited to walk the rounds and admire
the fruit in the garden of an old acquaintance, who pointed
out all the beauties of his orchard, without, however, asking the
company to partake of any of the tempting display. This was
too much for Swift, who having a happy art of inventing rhymes
to suit his purposes, applied it in the following manner on the occasion;
"I remember," said he, stopping under a very heavy laden
bough, "that my dear old grandmother had a saying which ran
thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 12em;"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Always pluck a peach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When within your reach."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p style="text-indent: 0;">Suiting the action to the word, he quickly put forth his hand and
took and ate&mdash;an example which was not lost on those who accompanied
him. Now we candidly confess that we were in an unguarded
moment tempted to essay a similar onslaught on Mrs.
Peachey's fruits, but, fortunately for all future visitors, were withheld
by the magnificent glass shades which protect these triumphs
of art. And are these the works that have been&mdash;that are refused
a fitting place in that great field of universal rivalry, the Crystal
Palace! What! can it be possible? Here are works of our own
nation not there&mdash;excluded! Surely, for the credit of the artiste,
and for its own honorable name, the Executive Committee should
enquire into the matter, and if there be any unworthy motive for
this, to us, incomprehensible exclusion of native art, let such be at
once and for ever dissipated by the breath of public opinion. There
is still ample space for them in the great building; and we hope
yet to see them there in their proper place. Mrs. Peachey has
spared neither labor nor expense to render her works worthy of her
reputation, and the continuance of that exalted patronage which
she has long enjoyed in Her Gracious Majesty the Queen, and the
highest among the aristocracy, and of the honor of her country.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
We were glad to perceive, on our visit, that although excluded
from their place among the nations, these exquisite works are
eagerly sought after and admired by crowds of the <i>elite</i> of fashion
and taste.&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>This highly talented lady (artiste to Her Majesty) has now on
private view, at her residence, 35, Rathbone-place, Oxford-street,
two splendid works of art, which were intended to have been placed
in the Crystal Palace, but the space allotted to her in one of the
galleries, being not at all adapted to such delicate productions,
Mrs. Peachey was compelled to refrain from carrying out her intention.
These beautiful productions, the sole work of Mrs. Peachey,
(who is self-taught,) comprise a monster bouquet of flowers, and a
large vase of fruit. The former comprehends specimens of almost
every flower known in this country, from the simple violet to the
full-blown magnolia; whilst in the latter we have specimens of the
principal English fruits, including the luscious pine apples and the
unpretending currant. Both groups are most tastefully arranged,
and an enormous expense has been incurred in the getting up of
the stands and glass shades. We advise our readers not to omit
seeing Mrs. Peachey's novel and truly beautiful works, and we predict
they will be abundantly gratified by their visit to her Exhibition.&mdash;<i>Reading
Mercury.</i></p></div>

<hr />

<div class="blockquot"><p>Mrs. Peachey's group of wax flowers, modelled for the Glass
Palace, is now on view at her house in Rathbone-place. Mrs.
Peachey, it seems, refused the space assigned her by the Committee,
on the ground that heat and darkness would, the one have
destroyed, and the other shrouded the marvels of her skill. The
bouquet (which is in a glass case, unsurpassed for chasteness and
beauty of design) is on a gigantic scale, and contains among the
rarest exotics the pride of the conservatory and the garden. We
were as much surprised as delighted, on paying a visit during the
past week at the skill which can imitate, and even rival, nature in
her most attractive aspects. Conspicuous among the lilies, and
other water flowers lining the base, is the Victoria Regia in its

<div class="blockquot"><p>An exhibition of wax flowers, at the residence (in Rathbone-place)
of Mrs. Peachey the artiste, is a perfect curiosity of its kind.
Almost every variety of English flower, exquisitely coloured, is
massed into an enormous bouquet, surprising alike from the largeness
of the conception and the minuteness of the execution. This
beautiful piece of art was prepared for the Great Exhibition, but
withdrawn by Mrs. Peachey in consequence of her dissatisfaction
with the place reserved for her.&mdash;<i>Examiner.</i></p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>We have inspected, at the private residence of Mrs. Peachey (in
Rathbone-place, Oxford-street), artiste in wax work to Her Majesty,
one of the most remarkable specimens of ingenuity and industry
which London at present contains. This is an immense bouquet of
wax flowers which that lady had prepared for the Crystal Palace,
but were not within its walls, for a reason to which we will presently
advert. Let us first describe this really magnificent work.
On four sturdy stone columns, tastefully designed, and edged with
gold, is a looking-glass platform upwards of four feet square, and
representing water. From the centre of this fairy lake rises a glass
column supporting a golden basket. In this is placed a bouquet
some two feet high, and of proportionate girth, in which are clustered
all the flowers we ever saw, and a great many which we never
saw&mdash;from the humble favorites of our <i>Rigolettes</i> and <i>Fleur de
Maries</i>, up to the floral aristocracy of the conservatory. There
they are exquisitely reproduced in all their graces of form and
colour, and arranged with the attention to contrast and general
effect which bespeaks the superintending eye of a real artiste. We
are afraid to say how many hundred wax flowers compose this
splendid bouquet; but we can safely say that, after having walked
round and round it, and, as we thought, having completely examined
it, the eye continually insisted on detecting some new
variety, and we finally abandoned the hope of ever becoming acquainted
with the whole. From the corners of the imitative waters
rise various superb specimens of water plants, fresh, cool, opaque-looking
productions; and at the foot of the glass column, as if
planted by accident, spring a few of our more common and very
beautiful garden flowers. The whole is covered by an enormous
bent glass shade, from the centre of which rises a pretty copy of
Her Majesty's crown. Nothing can be more beautiful or in better
taste than the object we have described. Near it is another vase,
not so large, and filled with wax fruit of every kind&mdash;the bloom of
the grape, the blush of the apple, the rich brown of the nut, the
velvet of the apricot, the glow of the orange, and the characteristics
of a hundred other fruits being represented with a tantalizing fidelity.
We would have flogged the fellow who broke the Portland
Vase, but we did not feel so sure, while gazing upon these admirable
imitations of the most delicious fruits, that we should have
been so severe upon some earnest gourmand who might dash down
the vase of which we speak, in wrath that his eye and his palate
had been so nobly cheated. The two vases, one of flowers, the
other of fruits, are certainly the most sumptuous specimens of wax
composition we ever saw.</p>

<p>As we have said, these works were intended by Her Majesty's
artiste for the Great Exhibition. On her applying for a site, that
lady states, that a very admirable one was assigned her upon the
ground-floor of the building, near the fountains. Upon her work
being complete, she was directed to place it in the gallery. This
Mrs. Peachey considered would be to jeopardise it, from the danger
so fragile a production would probably sustain in being taken up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
stairs, and still more from the heat of the sun, to which the wax
would in that situation be exposed, and which would speedily produce
Icarian results destructive to the work. We are not disposed
to enter into the question in any spirit of censure. We know too
well the <i>innumerable difficulties</i> with which the Executive Committee
have had to contend in arranging the contents of the enormous
building, to cavil at any decision they may have arrived at;
but we have now had the opportunity of seeing two very beautiful
works of English industry which would have been a credit to the
Exhibition.&mdash;<i>Morning Chronicle.</i></p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>Those forms which our continental neighbours take such wondrous
care in imitating in the perishable material of muslin, Mrs.
Peachey, Her Majesty's artiste, of 35, Rathbone-place, endeavours
to perpetuate in the more endurable materials of wax. Naturally
afraid of jeopardising the work on which so much time and labour
has been bestowed, Mrs. Peachey has withheld her contribution
from the Great Exhibition; whether wisely or not, we are not here
called upon to pronounce.</p>

<p>We can only bear witness to the evidently botanical fidelity of
execution with which the forms and colours so lavishly spread
throughout nature have been mimicked. In wax work generally,
one is made painfully aware of the all-powerful presence of the
forceps, but here we notice little or nothing of the kind, this is
especially the case with the small blossoms, which expand their
petals throughout a monster bouquet in wax.</p>

<p>In thus perfecting the imitative arts, however, no sense should
be left unsatisfied; to the pleasure of seeing, might be super-added
that of smelling. But in this further aim might be lost sight of
that great object, viz., utility, which at present is one of the aims
successfully attained by Mrs. Peachey.&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p></div>
